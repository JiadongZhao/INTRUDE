Is this acceptable? Is there a way to implement a global switch to skip tests that would require such a heavy network access? Especially how to implement such a switch so as not to pollute the doctests in the documentation.\n\nEdit: there is no example for the useage of the `load_lfw_pairs` function that is used for the official face verification task.

I think we should deprecate the reorder=False(reorder=True?) parameter and potentially (up for debate) have some threshold in case there are some small negative values in np.diff(tpr) or np.diff(fpr)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n#### (1)add tolerance to roc_auc_score when checking whether x is increasing. (discarded)\r\n<!--\r\nCurrently, when setting reordering=False, auc will check whether x is increasing and raise error if not. But sometimes python will introduce slight error when doing float calculation and users will unexpectedly get an error indicating that x is not sorted. So it might be better to allow some tolerance when checking whether x is increasing.\r\n-->\r\n#### (2)improve error message when x is neither increasing nor decreasing.\r\n#### (3)deprecate reorder parameter. reorder=False is now the default behaviour.\r\nreorder=True is introduced in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/commit/9f18586ebfc835810afff50fcc3449265501bbcb for roc_auc_score. Now it is not used in roc_auc_score due to #9786.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\ncc @jnothman @lesteve \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

Explain your changes.\n\nLearning curve will fail in some cases (not produce a learning curve). For example if using an estimator that raises when only one class is present - this may happen for the first iterations (small number of training samples). To fix this, learning_curve now takes error_score as a parameter and propagates it, the parameter's default value in learning_curve is 'raise' so the current behavior of failing is maintained - but this gives the option to set it to a value and have a learning_curve produced despite it failing for some iterations.\n#### Any other comments?\n\n<!--\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

Because some only have the volume name not its UUID, they use the list function in gophercloud to iterate over all volumes to find a match. This incurs severe performance problems on OpenStack projects with lots of volumes (sometimes thousands) since it needs to send a new request when the current page does not contain a match. A better way of doing this is use the `?name=XXX` query parameter to refine the results.\r\n\r\n**Which issue this PR fixes**:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26404\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nThere were 2 ways of addressing this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Use the `name` query parameter\r\n2. Instead of using the list function, switch to using volume UUIDs and use the GET function instead. You'd need to change the signature of a few functions though, such as [`DeleteVolume`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/cinder/cinder.go#L49), so I'm not sure how backwards compatible that is.\r\n\r\nSince #1 does effectively the same as #2, I went with it because it ensures BC.\r\n\r\nOne assumption that is made is that the `volumeName` being retrieved matches exactly the name of the volume in Cinder. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I see no reason why cloud providers would want to append/prefix things arbitrarily. \r\n\r\n**Release note**:\r\n```release-note\r\nImproves performance of Cinder volume attach/detach operations\r\n```\r\n",

The reason for this is due to this commit: 88936c2c84ba08b041c5b9f31a03944bf22bf1f4 which deprecated `provider` for `driver`, so now you cannot query profile information with the `cloud_providers_config` since the profile configuration uses `provider` instead of `driver`. So i moved the `ssh_*` and medialink settings into the provider config on the testing slaves.\r\n\r\n### New Behavior\r\nTests pass\r\n\r\n### Tests written?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n",

Resolves Issue #849.\n\nThe only potentially surprising behavior is that some `expanding_` functions differ from their NumPy equivalents in whether they preserve `NaN`s. For example, `expanding_max(s)` is equivalent to `rolling_max(s, len(s), min_periods=1)`, but both produce different output from `s.cummax()`, as the latter always returns `NaN` for every `NaN` in `s`. I don't have a strong opinion on which output is correct, aside from thinking `rolling_` and `expanding_` should agree.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "This pull request provides `ServiceManager` factories for the `Zend\\Session` component. It includes the following:\n- A new `Zend\\Session\\Storage\\Factory` class for creating instances of storage adapters. This is completely de-coupled from the `ServiceManager`.\n- `Zend\\Session\\Service` namespace with the following:\n  - `SessionConfigFactory`, for instantiating a session configuration object. This utilizes the `session_config` key of the `Config` service. If a `config_class` subkey is available, the class name it defines will be used as the configuration class. The entire `session_config` array is passed to the configuration class's `setOptions()` method. This factory should be assigned to the service name `Zend\\Session\\Config\\ConfigInterface`.\n  - `StorageFactory`, for instantiating a storage instance. It utilizes the `session_storage` key of the `Config` service, and expects it to be in the format:\n    \n    ``` php\n    array(\n        'type' => 'ShortName Or FQCN of Storage Class',\n        'options' => array(/* any valid options for the given storage class */),\n    )\n    ```\n    \n    The type and options are passed to `Zend\\Session\\Storage\\Factory` to create and return an instance. This factory should be assigned to the service name `Zend\\Session\\Storage\\StorageInterface`.\n  - `SessionManagerFactory`, for instantiating a `Zend\\Session\\SessionManager` instance. If any of the services `Zend\\Session\\Config\\ConfigInterface`, `Zend\\Session\\Storage\\StorageInterface`, or `Zend\\Session\\SaveHandler\\SaveHandlerInterface` are present, they will be used to instantiate the `SessionManager` instance. This service should be assigned to the service name `Zend\\Session\\ManagerInterface`.\n  - `ContainerAbstractFactory`, for instantiating `Zend\\Session\\Container` instances. It uses the `session_containers` key of the `Config` service, and expects the value of that key to be an array of container names. If a `Zend\\Session\\ManagerInterface` service is present, it will be used to instantiate `Container` instances. Container service names MUST be prefixed with `SessionContainer\\` for the factory to match. This means that the following definition:\n    \n    ``` php\n    'session_containers' => array(\n      'foo',\n      'Captcha',\n    )\n    ```\n    \n    defines the services `SessionContainer\\foo` and `SessionContainer\\Captcha`.\n\nAll factories are completely opt-in, and `Zend\\ServiceManager` has been added as an **optional** dependency.\n\nAs a full example of configuration:\n\n``` php\nreturn array(\n    'service_manager' => array(\n        'factories' => array(\n            'Zend\\Session\\Config\\ConfigInterface' => 'Zend\\Session\\Service\\SessionConfigFactory',\n            'Zend\\Session\\Storage\\StorageInterface' => 'Zend\\Session\\Service\\SessionStorageFactory',\n            'Zend\\Session\\ManagerInterface' => 'Zend\\Session\\Service\\SessionManagerFactory',\n        ),\n        'abstract_factories' => array(\n            'Zend\\Session\\Service\\ContainerAbstractFactory',\n        ),\n    ),\n    'session_config' => array(\n        'remember_me_seconds' => 1800,\n        'name' => 'my_app',\n    ),\n    'session_storage' => array(\n        'type' => 'SessionArrayStorage',\n        'options' => array(), // Likely don't want to seed it\n    ),\n    'session_containers' => array(\n        'Captcha',\n        'User',\n        'FlashMessages',\n    ),\n);\n```\n\nYou would then retrieve services within factories as follows:\n\n```\n$user = $services->get('SessionContainer\\User');\n$messages = $services->get('SessionContainer\\FlashMessages');\n\n$manager = $services->get('Zend\\Session\\ManagerInterface');\n```\n",

      "pr1.desc": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nFor a long time now, I was getting annoyed by the derived `Debug` impl of `Duration`. Usually, I use `Duration` to either do quick'n'dirty benchmarking or measuring the time of some operation in general. The output of the derived Debug impl is hard to parse for humans: is { secs: 0, nanos: 968360102 } or { secs: 0, nanos 98507324 } longer? \r\n\r\nSo after running into the annoyance several times (sometimes building my own function to print the Duration properly), I decided to tackle this. Now the output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDuration::new(1, 0)                 => 1s\r\nDuration::new(1, 1)                 => 1.000000001s\r\nDuration::new(1, 300)               => 1.0000003s\r\nDuration::new(1, 4000)              => 1.000004s\r\nDuration::new(1, 600000)            => 1.0006s\r\nDuration::new(1, 7000000)           => 1.007s\r\nDuration::new(0, 0)                 => 0ns\r\nDuration::new(0, 1)                 => 1ns\r\nDuration::new(0, 300)               => 300ns\r\nDuration::new(0, 4001)              => 4.001\u00b5s\r\nDuration::new(0, 600300)            => 600.3\u00b5s\r\nDuration::new(0, 7000000)           => 7ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I implemented the formatting manually and didn't use floats. No information is \"lost\" when printing. So `Duration::new(123_456_789_000, 900_000_001)` prints as `123456789000.900000001s`.\r\n\r\n~~This is not yet finished~~, but I wanted to open the PR now already in order to get some feedback (maybe everyone likes the derived impl).\r\n\r\n### Still ToDo:\r\n\r\n- [x] Respect precision ~~and width~~ parameter of the formatter (see [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50364#issuecomment-386107107))\r\n\r\n### Alternatives/Decisions\r\n\r\n- Should large durations displayed in minutes, hours, days, ...? For now, I decided not to because the current formatting is close the how a `Duration` is stored. From this new `Debug` output, you can still easily see what the values of `secs` and `nanos` are. A formatting like `3h 27m 12s 9ms` might be more appropriate for a `Display` impl?\r\n- Should this rather be a `Display` impl and should `Debug` be derived? Maybe this formatting is too fancy for `Debug`? In my opinion it's not and, as already mentioned, from the current format one can still very easily determine the values for `secs` and `nanos`.\r\n- Whitespace between the number and the unit?\r\n\r\n### Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\n- ~~The combined diff sucks. Rather review both commits individually.~~\r\n- ~~In the unit test, I am building my own type implementing `fmt::Write` to test the output. Maybe there is already something like that which I can use?~~\r\n- My `Debug` impl block is marked as `#[stable(...)]`... but that's fine since the derived Debug impl was stable already, right?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~~Apart from the main change, I moved all `time` unit tests into the `tests` directory. All other `libcore` tests are there, so I guess it was simply an oversight. Prior to this change, the `time` tests weren't run, so I guess this is kind of a bug fix. If my `Debug` impl is rejected, I can of course just send the fix as PR.~~ (this was already merged in #50466)\r\n",

IdVisitor only overrides visit_id, and for each node searches\r\nfor builtin lints previously added to the session; LateContext overrides\r\na number of methods, and runs late lints.  When LateContext encounters an\r\nitem, it first has IdVisitor walk everything in it except nested items\r\n(OnlyBodies), then recurses into it itself - i.e. there are two separate\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nAside from apparently being unnecessary, this separation prevents lint\r\nattributes (allow/deny/warn) on non-item HIR nodes from working\r\nproperly.  Test case:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// generates warning without this change\r\nfn main() { #[allow(unreachable_code)] loop { break; break; } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLateContext contains logic to merge attributes seen into the current lint\r\nsettings while walking (with_lint_attrs), but IdVisitor does not.  So\r\nsuch attributes will affect late lints (because they are called from\r\nLateContext), and if the node contains any items within it, they will\r\naffect builtin lints within those items (because that IdVisitor is run\r\nwhile LateContext is within the attributed node), but otherwise the\r\nattributes will be ignored for builtin lints.\r\n\r\nThis change simply removes IdVisitor and moves its visit_id into\r\nLateContext itself.  Hopefully this doesn't break anything...\r\n\r\nAlso added walk calls to visit_lifetime and visit_lifetime_def\r\nrespectively, so visit_lifetime_def will recurse into the lifetime and\r\nvisit_lifetime will recurse into the name.  In principle this could\r\nconfuse lint plugins.  This is \"necessary\" because walk_lifetime calls\r\nvisit_id on the lifetime; of course, an alternative would be directly\r\ncalling visit_id (which would require manually iterating over the\r\nlifetimes in visit_lifetime_def), but that seems less clean.",

      "pr2.desc": "This is bug resulted from the code changes in 1.4 to add next/previous navigation, bug 918303, which added `message_cursor`. However the bug is triggered by an existing weakness in `model` that dates back to 1.2 days. To be clear though, this bug does not manifest in 1.2 or 1.3.\n\nThe `folder_picker` called `model.changeFolder` even though the folder selection has not changed.\n\n`model` then did not check for if the folder was actually different, and that triggered a 'folder' event to be emitted.\n\n`message_list` received that event in `_folderChanged`, which called `showFolder`. `showFolder` noticed the folders were the same and disregarded the notification, so it did not clear the message list.\n\n`message_cursor` also received the `folder` event from `model`, and it did not check to see if the folder was different and asked for a new messages slice. In 1.2/1.3 code, the messages slice was handled by `message_list`'s `showFolder` method, which did detect for actual folder changes, and it is why the bug is not present there.\n\nThe new messages slice in `header_cursor` triggered new messages slice events, which `message_list` was listening for, so it added the duplicates to the list.\n\nSo the fix, instead of asking all consumers of that event if the folder is actually different is for `model` to not emit a folder event if the folder selection is not actually different.\n",

This is about face-lifting these important chapters after several years of us as a community realizing what's more important and what's less important. More notes:\n- I removed some information about using the `defaults` to pass additional information to your controller from this chapter. This is too early and we have this now: http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/routing/extra_information.html\n- I removed `ContainerAware` information. This is not the right spot... and maybe nothing is. I don't see much use-case for this - it seems like you'd either extend the base Controller or register your controller as a service.\n- I kind of want to remove or move the forwarding stuff. I can't find a real use-case for doing a forward from one controller to another. It adds a lot of overhead and I don't see any situation for it.\n\nThanks!\n",

Even if we use less version and compile everything we still need to add extra classes to our markup - and I think here's a place for more nested less files.\n\nAs much as it is possible we should be able to use LESS power and leave our markup as semantic as it can only be but folks who are starting to use bootstrap or people who are in a furious rush should be able to use classes as they are now. \n## Let's say you have and unordered list:\n\n```\n<section id=\"top\">\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n```\n\nNow in your LESS stylesheet you can do:\n\n```\n#section {\n  ul {\n    .nav;\n    .nav-tabs;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you'll get same result like you would type class=\"nav nav-tabs\"\n\n```\n#section {\n  ul {\n    .nav;\n    .nav-pills;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you'll get same result like you would type class=\"nav nav-pills\"\n\n```\n#section {\n  ul {\n    .nav;\n    .nav-pills;\n    .nav-stacked;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you'll get same result like you would type class=\"nav nav-pills nav-stacked\"\n\n```\n#section {\n  ul {\n    .nav;\n    .nav-tabs;\n    .nav-justified;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you'll get same result like you would type class=\"nav nav-tabs nav-justified\"\n\n```\n#section {\n  ul {\n    .nav;\n    .nav-pills;\n    .nav-justified;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you'll get same result like you would type class=\"nav nav-pills nav-justified\"\n\nAs you can see the benefit of more nested rules in the LESS files is obvious - we dont need to touch our html markup to style an element (nav in this case).\n\nPlease say what you think about such changes and if's that a good direction for extending bootstrap.\n\nTested on: Firefox 20.0.1, Chrome 26.0.1410.64 m, Internet Explorer 10.0.9200.16521\n",

However, if one is provided, it overrides all of the default options. This PR applies the options object to the defaults, only changing the values that are explicitly set.\n\nThe approach in this PR also adds a method to `test/common.js`, allowing specific global variables to be whitelisted. This is because the CLI REPL sets `useGlobal` to `true`, and then defines `module` and `require()` as globals. Alternative approaches could be to set `useGlobal` to `false` (which was what was silently happening before) or set `common.globalCheck` to `false`. I prefer the current approach because it is more representative of what happens in the real world, and still performs the global checks.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "**Why we need this PR**:\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with our current fluentd-gcp image:\r\n\r\n- It pulls in lots of unused packages, which expose unnecessary risk and create noise in CVE scans (and scare customers). The most notable example is the fluent-ui, which pulls in rails.\r\n- `curl | sh ` is not a good practice for a Dockerfile. First, the script is not checked in the same source control branch, so builds are not reproducible. Second, the actions it is taking are opaque. Third, in this case, using non-standard packages means they're harder to manage with CVE scans & upstream fixes.\r\n\r\n**What is changed by this PR?**\r\n\r\n- Rather than relying on td-agent (which includes fluent-ui), use standard upstream packages. This is largely based off the [official fluentd debian-based image](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-docker-image/blob/master/v0.12/debian/Dockerfile).\r\n- Rebases the image on debian-base (depends on https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41915). We would like to move towards a single full-distro base image we can maintain. This change should be relatively minor.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes, the image size is reduced from 360.6 MB to 185.8 MB (nearly half). Many packages were removed, and the full diff (focus on the unversioned files) is listed here: https://github.com/timstclair/kubernetes/commit/3fb704f977875bb4cbb64687b2f6836fbe101cf6\r\n\r\n**Which issue this PR fixes** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/40248\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nThis change both addresses security concerns, and is expected to greatly reduce the maintenance burden of the fluentd-gcp image. I'd *really* like to get this into 1.6, so please prioritize this review if possible.\r\n\r\nI tested this by running the default e2e suite on a private e2e cluster using the new image. If there are other tests you'd like me to run, please let me know ASAP.\r\n\r\n**Release note**:\r\n```release-note\r\nCleanup fluentd-gcp image: rebase on debian-base, switch to upstream packages, remove fluent-ui & rails\r\n```\r\n",

All I needed to do was create another Tokenizer, because `ParseNode` ( representation for nodes which are yet to be created) is used by the TreeBuilder and the Sink, and the `Tokenizer` is the 'lowermost' type concerned with these two types.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I created one and placed it in `async_html.rs`, and also created a new Sink which deals with `ParseNode`s. I changed the methods in ServoParser to take an `async` argument too, which decides which Tokenizer will be used. The Tokenizer isn't exactly *async* for now, but this PR separates action creation from execution, which allows the async behaviour to be implemented later. Right now, all actions are executed soon after they are created.\r\n\r\nThe Sink consists of two Hashmaps, `nodes`, which contains the actual nodes, with the key being their corresponding `ParseNode`'s id, and `parse_node_data`, which contains metadata about the nodes. \r\n\r\nIt's still a bit rough, (I can't figure out how to deal with `complete_script` and `is_mathml_annotation_xml_integration_point`, along with some other parts I wrote in a hurry), but I believe the overall design is sound.

Not really that beautiful but well... I think this is a BC we should do as it makes the code quite hard to extend.\n\nAnyway, this PR adds a new ModuleManager feature that allow to add routes either from a getRouteConfig in your Module.php, or using the routes key in service manager config:\n\n``` php\nreturn array(\n    'routes' => array(\n        'invokables' => array(\n            'Rest' => 'ZfrRest\\Mvc\\Router\\Route\\Rest'\n        )\n    )\n);\n```\n\nAnd then use it in the router:\n\n``` php\nreturn array(\n    'router' => array(\n        'routes' => array(\n            'dummy' => array(\n                   'type' => 'Rest'\n            )\n        )\n    )\n);\n```\n\nEDIT : @weierophinney , regarding this file: https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/develop/library/Zend/Mvc/Service/ModuleManagerFactory.php#L82\n\nIt's just growing and growing. Don't you think we could allow each plugin manager to register itself to the ServiceListener. It makes things easier to discover (jsut open the plugin maanger and you immediately know what is the config key and so...). I never remember this file...\n",

When `X` or `y` was given as a list to `train_test_split`, it was converted to an array before, but is no longer. In the case of `X` this could be considered a bug-fix (for lists of strings). There is an off-chance that this breaks someone's code, though. `GridSearchCV` now passes `y` though as a list, without converting.

This was not in accordance with the UX spec. The old \"auto hide after N seconds\" logic via _hideNewMessage was kept in there by mistake.\n- [Bug 1056518](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056518): use \"N New Messages\" instead of \"N New Emails\" to also match spec. l10n ID was changed to reflect the change in messaging.\n- [Bug 1056515](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056515): \"N New Messages\" was not centered on the first showing of it, particularly when the Top Arrow was also shown at first.\n\nThe last one was the trickiest of them. It was caused by the l10n mutation stuff changing the size later, and also, the full size was not known until it became visible. So I went with the left:50%, transformX -50% solution, so that explicit sizes did not need to be calculated. However for that to work, I had to turn off animation to change the horizontal position then show it.\n\nThe end result is much better than before. However, I do notice about a 2px jump at the end of the N New Messages transition. Also, if the Top Arrow is not showing, the animation is not smooth, the N New Messages just pops in. On desktop, it is smooth, so this suggest some sort of animation drop on the device. That pop in effect happened before this changeset though too, so overall this is a better experience, and we can file follow up bugs to get it better. Most importantly, those follow up bugs do not need new l10n strings, so they could land later.\n",

Unlike things like `require('sys')` that have effectively zero cost, this interface creates significant maintenance burden (see #3503, #7042, #7575) and makes the code harder to follow, which raises the barrier for contributions (brought up by @feross in #4530; also affected me personally while investigating #9671).\r\n\r\nNote that `test-fs-read-zero-length.js` and `test-fs-read.js` aren't modified - I deleted them and renamed `test-fs-read-buffer-zero-length.js` and `test-fs-buffer-read.js`, since the \"buffer\" part doesn't carry any meaning anymore.",

The versions to use on the `master` branch is `~3.1` for both `composer.json` files, as the authentication provider and the user provider rely on the new interface, and the `LdapInterface::query()` method, instead of `LdapClientInterface::search()`, which is deprecated.\n",

      "pr1.desc": "For Tuesday, the 23rd, it's not even been two weeks and the backlog is already pretty amazing:\n### Notable changes\n- **buffer**:\n  - You can now supply an `encoding` argument when filling a Buffer `Buffer#fill(string[, start[, end]][, encoding])`, supplying an existing Buffer will also work with `Buffer#fill(buffer[, start[, end]])`. See the [API documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_fill_value_offset_end_encoding) for details on how this works. (Trevor Norris) [#4935](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4935)\n  - `Buffer#indexOf()` no longer requires a `byteOffset` argument if you also wish to specify an `encoding`: `Buffer#indexOf(val[, byteOffset][, encoding])`. (Trevor Norris) [#4803](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4803)\n- **child_process**: `spawn()` and `spawnSync()` now support a `'shell'` option to allow for optional execution of the given command inside a shell. If set to `true`, `cmd.exe` will be used on Windows and `/bin/sh` elsewhere. A path to a custom shell can also be passed to override these defaults. On Windows, this option allows `.bat.` and `.cmd` files to be executed with `spawn()` and `spawnSync()`. (Colin Ihrig) [#4598](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4598)\n- **http_parser**: Update to http-parser 2.6.2 to fix an unintentionally strict limitation of allowable header characters (James M Snell) [#5237](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5237)\n- **dgram**: `socket.send()` now supports accepts an array of Buffers or Strings as the first argument. See the [API docs](https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/v6.0.0-nightly201602102848f84332/docs/api/dgram.html#dgram_socket_send_msg_offset_length_port_address_callback) for details on how this works. (Matteo Collina) [#4374](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4374)\n- **http**: Fix a bug where handling headers will mistakenly trigger an `'upgrade'` event where the server is just advertising its protocols. This bug can prevent HTTP clients from communicating with HTTP/2 enabled servers. (Fedor Indutny) [#4337](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4337)\n- **net**: Added a `listening` Boolean property to `net` and `http` servers to indicate whether the server is listening for connections. (Jos\u00e9 Moreira) [#4743](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4743)\n- **node**: The C++ `node::MakeCallback()` API is now reentrant and calling it from inside another `MakeCallback()` call no longer causes the `nextTick` queue or Promises microtask queue to be processed out of order. (Trevor Norris) [#4507](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507)\n- **tls**: Add a new `tlsSocket.getProtocol()` method to get the negotiated TLS protocol version of the current connection. (Brian White) [#4995](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4995)\n- **vm**: Introduce new `'produceCachedData'` and `'cachedData'` options to `new vm.Script()` to interact with V8's code cache. When a new `vm.Script` object is created with the `'produceCachedData'` set to `true` a `Buffer` with V8's code cache data will be produced and stored in `cachedData` property of the returned object. This data in turn may be supplied back to another `vm.Script()` object with a `'cachedData'` option if the supplied source is the same.

It applies the same strategy, that we already use for monomorphizations, to closures, that is, instead of emitting symbols with `weak_odr` linkage in order to avoid symbol conflicts, we emit them with `internal` linkage, with the side effect that we have to copy code instead of just linking to it, if more than one codegen unit is involved.\nWith this PR, the compiler will only apply this strategy for targets where we would actually run into a problem when using `weak_odr` linkage, in other words nothing will change for platforms except for MinGW.\n\nThe solution implemented here has one restriction that could be lifted with some more effort, but it does not seem to be worth the trouble since it will go away once we use only MIR-trans: If someone compiles code\n1. on MinGW,\n2. with more than one codegen unit,\n3. _not_ using MIR-trans,\n4. and runs into a closure inlined from another crate\n\nthen the compiler will abort and suggest to compile either with just one codegen unit or `-Zorbit`.\n\nWhat's nice about this is that I lays a foundation for also doing the same for generics: using weak linkage where possible and thus enabling some more space optimizations that the linker can do.\n\n~~This PR also contains a test case for compiling a program that contains more than 2^15 closures. It's a huge, generated file with almost 100K LOCs. I did not commit the script for generating the file but could do so. Alternatively, maybe someone wants to come up with a way of doing this with macros.~~\nThe test file is implemented via macros now (thanks @alexcrichton!)\n\nOpinions?\n\nFixes #34793.\n\ncc @rust-lang/compiler \n",

Note that `nanos` is an `i32` and not `u32` as suggested, because `i32` is easier to deal with, and it is not exposed anyway. Some methods now take `i64` instead of `i32` due to the increased range. Some methods, like `num_milliseconds`, now return an `Option<i64>` instead of `i64`, because the range of `Duration` is now larger than e.g. 2^63 milliseconds.\n\nA few remarks:\n- Negating `MIN` is impossible. I chose to return `MAX` as `-MIN`, but it is one nanosecond less than the actual negation. Is this the desired behaviour?\n- In `std::io::timer`, some functions accept a `Duration`, which is internally converted into a number of milliseconds. However, the range of `Duration` is now larger than 2^64 milliseconds. There is already a FIXME in the file that this should be addressed (without a ticket number though). I chose to silently use 0 ms if the duration is too long.

The basic change here was to leave the `try_get` function exposed but have it return a `DiagnosticBuilder` instead of a `CycleError`. This means that it should be a compiler bug to *not* handle the error as dropping a diagnostic should result in a complier panic.\r\n\r\nAfter that change it was then necessary to update the compiler's callsites of `try_get` to handle the error coming out. These were handled as:\r\n\r\n* The `sized_constraint` and `needs_drop_raw` checks take the diagnostic and defer it as a compiler bug. This was a new piece of functionality added to the error handling infrastructure, and the idea is that for both these checks a \"real\" compiler error should be emitted elsewhere, so it's only a bug if we don't actually emit the complier error elsewhere. \r\n* MIR inlining was updated to just ignore the diagnostic. This is being tracked by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43542 which sounded like it either already had some work underway or was planning to change regardless.\r\n* The final case, `item_path`, is still sort of up for debate. At the time of this writing this PR simply removes the invocations of `try_get` there, assuming that the query will always succeed. This turns out to be true for the test suite anyway! It sounds like, though, that this logic was intended to assist in \"weird\" situations like `RUST_LOG` where debug implementations can trigger at any time. This PR would therefore, however, break those implementations.\r\n\r\nI'm unfortunately sort of out of ideas on how to handle `item_path`, but other thoughts would be welcome!\r\n\r\nCloses #42633",
