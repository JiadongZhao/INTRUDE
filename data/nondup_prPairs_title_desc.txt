Is this acceptable? Is there a way to implement a global switch to skip tests that would require such a heavy network access? Especially how to implement such a switch so as not to pollute the doctests in the documentation.\n\nEdit: there is no example for the useage of the `load_lfw_pairs` function that is used for the official face verification task.

Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe contribution guidelines: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-Pull-Requests\r\n-->\r\n#### Reference Issue\r\n<!-- Example: Fixes #1234 -->\r\nproposed in #9786 by @lesteve \r\n\r\n> with this change reorder=False(reorder=True?) in the auc function is not used in our code. I think we should deprecate the reorder=False(reorder=True?) parameter and potentially (up for debate) have some threshold in case there are some small negative values in np.diff(tpr) or np.diff(fpr)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n#### (1)add tolerance to roc_auc_score when checking whether x is increasing. (discarded)\r\n<!--\r\nCurrently, when setting reordering=False, auc will check whether x is increasing and raise error if not. But sometimes python will introduce slight error when doing float calculation and users will unexpectedly get an error indicating that x is not sorted. So it might be better to allow some tolerance when checking whether x is increasing.\r\n-->\r\n#### (2)improve error message when x is neither increasing nor decreasing.\r\n#### (3)deprecate reorder parameter. reorder=False is now the default behaviour.\r\nreorder=True is introduced in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/commit/9f18586ebfc835810afff50fcc3449265501bbcb for roc_auc_score. Now it is not used in roc_auc_score due to #9786.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\ncc @jnothman @lesteve \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.
