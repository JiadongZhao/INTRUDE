Longer term, I think it is better to refactor those uses to fit into the Cards more. However, I want to do that work after landing the custom element work.\n\nsetStatusColor allows a few different options for choosing the color, see API docs in mail_common. The main goal is to avoid hard coding specific colors in the HTML or JavaScript, except for the meta tag itself, and setting up a default color.\n\nI went with 'status' instead of 'theme' for the APIs and properties, since to me themes could be something different, could be something configured inside that app, and all of this right now is about setting the status bar color. Maybe that changes in the future, and status is too narrowly defined though. Open to renaming if reviewer thinks that helps. Either way, we are probably going to need to rename if in-app themes or some other status thing is introduced, or theme-color used for more than just status.\n\nAlso includes a fix for centering the Cancel button in value_selector, that is the common.css change.\n\nThe color is set before starting the card transition, since the animation performs better. If done in the transition startup logic, but after transition classes on the cards are set, our animation transition became choppy. If set after our transition completes, the status bar looks lazy, too much out of step with the UI. As it is now, the color fade in the status bar is non-optimal for our \"immediate\" card transitions, since that UI updates fast, but the status bar color still needs fade time. It was reviewed by UX, so that is what we will go with for now, since setting the color is the only toggle we have for that status bar color. \n\nI will file follow up bugs related to status bar icon colors (they don't seem to adjust well to some of our color choices) and asking for maybe a \"transition immediately, no fade\" option. It will help to have this landed though to give a point of reference/reproducibility for those bugs.\n",

This is important because today if you pass a function for template/templateUrl in DDO, you get element as attrs, but for DI you rely on the injectable DDO factory. In the component helper you don't have a factory, therefore we make all functions that can be passed in options injectable.\n\nDocs are still missing obviously, but I would like to get some feedback before moving on.\n\nCloses #10007 \n",

      "pr1.desc": "**Summary**\r\n\r\nThe goal for this PR is to be able to use the `POST /containers/{name}/wait` API in order to no longer rely on the Events API when doing `docker run ...` and `docker start` in attached mode. Here is the set of behavioral changes in the API and CLI:\r\n\r\n- The wait API now has on optional query parameter, `condition`, which specifies the state of the container which the client would like to wait for:\r\n\r\n    - **`not-running`**\r\n\r\n        This is the default value which maintains the existing behavior of the Wait API. It blocks if the container is in a state which is considered to be *running*, i.e., any of *running*, *paused*, or *restarting*. If it is already not in any of those states, then it would not block at all and return immediately with the current exit code.\r\n\r\n    - **`next-exit`**\r\n\r\n        This condition allows the client to wait for the container's state to *change* to a not-running state or to be removed. This is different from the *not-running* option because it will block if the container is in the *created*, *exited*, *dead*, or *removing* state, blocking through a transition to one of the running states and back to one of *exited* states or until the container is removed, whichever comes first. It is similar to waiting for a *die* or *destroy* event. This option is very useful to use before issuing a container start API request.\r\n\r\n    - **`removed`**\r\n\r\n        This condition allows the client to wait for the container to be removed. It is similar to waiting for a *destroy* event.\r\n\r\n- The Wait API will now return HTTP response headers immediately. This serves an an acknowledgement that a wait has been registered. The JSON response body will not be returned until the wait condition is met.\r\n\r\n- The Wait API's request context is extended to wait for a `http.CloseNotifier` event in the case that the client closes the connection while the server is blocked on the wait condition. This prevents leaked goroutines but should only be necessary until we switch to using Go 1.8's request context which cancels automatically if the client disconnects.\r\n\r\n- ~~To handle a manual detach (when the user enters the detach keys sequence when attached in TTY mode), the CLI now detects this key sequence, stops sending stdin, and causes the CLI to exit immediately. This is done as an alternative to waiting for a *detach* event.~~ The rug has been pulled out from under this bullet point. This will have to be done in the github.com/docker/cli repo along with the other CLI changes.\r\n\r\nFollow-up to #31794\r\n\r\nFixes #32242",

      "pr1.desc": "This commit resolves a memory leak (#11501) in apps running Glimmer. The root cause of the issue was that a flag governing whether components/views remove themselves from their parent was being set incorrectly, so that when the code to cleanup a destroyed view ran, it was not removed from its parent\u2019s `childViews` array.\n\nSpecifically, three hooks are invoked when a render node is cleared:\n1. `env.hooks.willCleanupNode`\n2. `Morph#cleanup`\n3. `env.hooks.didCleanupNode`\n\nPrior to this commit, `willCleanupNode` would blindly set the owner view\u2019s `isDestroyingSubtree` flag if there was a view set in the `env` (i.e., basically always).\n\nSidebar on the `isDestroyingSubtree` flag: this flag is used as a performance optimization. If a view is destroyed, we want to remove that view from its parent\u2019s `childViews` array so that garbage collection can happen. However, it is unnecessary to remove child views from the destroyed view\u2019s `childViews` array; the GC will take care of any clean up when the link between the view hierarchy and the destroyed view is severed.\n\nFor example, imagine this hypothetical view hierarchy:\n\n```\n      A\n     / \\\n    B   C\n       / \\\n      D   E\n```\n\nIf the render node for view C is destroyed, we need to remove C from A\u2019s array of child views. However, it is unnecessary to remove D or E from C\u2019s child views, because they will be imminently removed by the GC, and temporarily lingering in the child views array does no harm.\n\nWe accomplish this by setting the `isDestroyingSubtree` flag on the root-most view in a hierarchy (view A in the example above), which we call the owner view. When the render node for C is destroyed, it removes C from A\u2019s child views array and sets the flag to true. When D and E\u2019s render nodes are destroyed, they see that the flag has already been flipped and do not remove their associated views from C\u2019s child views array.\n\nThe memory leak manifested itself when the a render node that did not have a view associated with it was destroyed, and contained a child render node that _did_ have a view associated. For example:\n\n``` handlebars\n{{#if foo}}\n  {{my-component}}\n{{/if}}\n```\n\nIn this case, the `willCleanupNode` hook would erroneously set the flag without actually moving the `my-component` view, because the render node for the `{{if}}` does not know about the component.\n\nWhen the cleanup for `{{my-component}}` finally happens (in Morph#cleanup), the flag has already been set, so the render node incorrectly assumes that its view is part of a subgraph that has already been severed.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the `willCleanupNode` hook is not doing any cleanup that is not already done in `Morph#cleanup`. We still do need `didCleanupNode` to clear the flag, but can leave individual render node cleanup to the render node itself.\n",

But I digress...\n\nThis diff results in a divergence between dev and prod behavior (specifically, more components will rerender more often in dev) because we no longer bail out of reconciliation in dev mode due to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3516/files causing there to always be a context variable change.

That is, when there is a context, a component would never be bailed out. Specifically, If we use `react-redux`, `react-router`, `react-intl` or any other lib which provides a context, we would get no bailout optimization.\n\nTo fix this, I suggest we use `shallowEqual` instead of `===`.

The next step would be to grab a copy of Oracle's Express Edition and install that onto your local machine or a VM, and with the sample database, connect to it from within Joomla using something like this (I added this code right before the closing body tag in the protostar template of a default Joomla install for testing from my end):\n\n```\n$options = [\n    'database' => 'TEST',\n    'user' => 'your_username',\n    'password' => 'your_password',\n    'host' => 'localhost',\n    'driver' => 'oracle',\n];\n?>\n<?php $oracle = JDatabase::getInstance($options); ?>\n<?php\n    //$result = $oracle->connected();\n    //$rows = $oracle->getTableColumns('SOME_TABLE', false);\n    //$rows = $oracle->getTableCreate('SOME_SCHEMA.SOME_TABLE');\n\n    //$rows = $oracle->getTableKeys('SOME_TABLE');\n\n    //$rows = $oracle->getTableList(null, true);\n    $rows = $oracle->getTableList('SOME_SCHEMA', true);\n\n    //$rows = $oracle->getVersion();\n    //$oracle->setDateFormat();\n    //$oracle->setQuery('SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE SOME_ID = 123');\n\n    /*\n    $pidm = 123;\n    $query = $oracle->getQuery(true);\n\n    $query->select('*');\n    $query->from('SOME_TABLE');\n    $query->where('SOME_ID = :some_id');\n\n    $query->bind(':some_id', $some_id);\n\n    $oracle->setQuery($query);\n    */\n\n    //$oracle->setQuery('SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE SOME_ID = :some_id');\n    //$oracle->getQuery()->bind(':some_id', $some_id);\n\n    //$oracle->setQuery('select * from SOME_TABLE', 0, 100);\n\n    /*\n    $oracle->toUpper();\n    $it = $oracle->getIterator(null, 'ArrayObject');\n\n    $rows = array();\n    foreach($it as $row)\n    {\n        $rows[] = $row;\n    }\n    */\n\n    //$rows = $oracle->loadObjectList();\n\n    //$affected = $oracle->getAffectedRows();\n    //$numRows = $oracle->getNumRows();\n\n    //$result2 = $oracle->connected();\n    echo \"<pre>\";\n    echo print_r($rows, true);\n    echo \"</pre>\";\n?>\n```\n\nMore info on what I've tested so far can be found over on the Issue #12560 page and I'm happy to answer questions that might come up too.\n\nI'm pretty sure this initial PR will fail due to code consistency checks, so I'll work on correcting those tomorrow morning.\n### Documentation Changes Required\n",

So, main thing here is whether we're happy with that function-interface or not.\n\nAs illustration of its power ;-), I ported the existing REPL-help system over into this system and it works as before, except that user-made help is now possible. I'll post a usage-demo to #3988.  The help system as in this pull-request is _not_ meant to stay like that.  It's thought as a transitional state to something fancy.\n\nSo:\n1) Added basic support to associate metadata to most objects. The data is stored in the `ObjectIdDict` `Base.META`.  However, interaction should be done through the functions:  `getmeta`, `setmeta!` & `hasmeta`\n\n2) Ported the existing REPL-help system over to work with this system.\n- `help` and `?` work as before (except 3-objects don't work, see test/help.jl)\n- user-made help is now possible through a `@doc`-macro and `doc`-function\n- Documentation of objects is kept in the metadata storage.\n   Documentation of non-objects, e.g. keywords, and macros\n   is kept in: `Base.Help.NONOBJ_DICT`.\n\nIssues:\n- every now and then I get a `ERROR: BoundsError()` when initializing the help from helpdb.jl\n- There is a strange bug with `eval` not picking up its documentation, no idea why.\n- how can macros be referred to, other than representing them as a string?\n  - I use now a separate Dict with string-keys for documenting macros and non-objects: keywords, `&&`, etc.\n- should some functions take the metadata into account?

On the other hand, this change should be almost orthogonal to that issue and won't make the situation much worse.\n3. The current limit is `2^31 - 1` and this is mainly because `DataType.size` is a `Int32`. According to @jiahao , this was because of not letting unsigned integer types polluting calculations.

I think I'm very close, but I've spent far too much time on this and I'm beginning to run out of ideas and energy.~~, but yay, I found the exit.\n\nThis is the latest attempt at `NTuple{N,T} -> Tuple{Vararg{T,N}}`, aka #10911, #10691. Julia builds and passes ~~many~~ all tests, ~~but borks on some (e.g., `subarray`). The current problem seems to be that a `VarState(Tuple{_<:Vararg{T,N}},false)` gets injected somewhere (leading ultimately to an attempted `Tuple{Vararg, ASCIIString}` and `Vararg type in non-final position` error). It's probably a 3-line fix, but I have not yet succeeded in finding the correct 3 lines (inference.jl is difficult for not-Jeff to hack on).~~\n\n~~This still contains~~The intermediate commits contain a lot of debugging code that ~~will eventually be~~ was deleted in the later commits. In the end, the way I got this ~~far~~to work was to write new versions of `jl_intersect_type`, `jl_subtype_le`, `type_morespecific`, and `type_match_`, which (1) called the old algorithm and stored the result, then (2) translated NTuples on-the-fly and then called the new algorithm with the translated arguments, and (3) printed some output if the two disagreed. ~~This branch is partway through the deletion of all that debugging code; before completing the migration I'd love to figure out where the problem is.~~\n\nIt turns out that we have enough differences in how `NTuple`s and `Tuple{Vararg}`s behave that some disagreements are unavoidable; one of the best things about this, presumably, is that such differences will go away. I even went to the trouble to catalog the differences; in the \"best\" column I use \"N\" to indicate that I think the new algorithm yields the most sensible result, and \"O\" to indicate the old algorithm. Only two of those four algorithms had differences, of which representative examples are:\n\n`jl_intersect_type`:\nnone (as measured by a <: b && b <: a)\n\n`jl_subtype_le`:\n\n| a | b | ta | invariant | old result | new result | best |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `_<:Tuple` | `Tuple` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `_<:Tuple{_<:Vararg{T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `Tuple{}` | `NTuple{#_<:Any, #T<:Any}` | 0 | 1 | 1 | ~~0~~1 | ~~O~~same |\n| `Tuple{Tuple{_<:Tuple{Any, Any}}}` | `Tuple{Tuple{Tuple{Any, Any}}}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `_<:Tuple{Vararg{Int64, #N<:Any}}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, #_<:Any}}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `Tuple{Symbol, Integer}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | ? |\n| `Tuple{Char, Char}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}}` | `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Int64, Vararg{Int64, N<:Any}}}}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Char}}, Tuple{Vararg{Any, N<:Any}}}` | `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}}, Tuple}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `Tuple{Tuple{_<:Tuple{Vararg{Any, N<:Any}}}, Int64}` | `Tuple{Tuple{Tuple{Vararg{Any, N<:Any}}}, Int64}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `Tuple{Tuple{Symbol, Vararg{Symbol, N<:Any}}, DataType, Type{T<:Any}}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `_<:Tuple{Symbol, Vararg{Symbol, N<:Any}}` | `Tuple` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `Tuple{DataType, Type}` | `Tuple{Vararg{#T<:Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `_<:Tuple{Tuple{Symbol, Vararg{Symbol, N<:Any}}, DataType, Type{T<:Any}}` | `Tuple{Tuple{Vararg{Any, N<:Any}}, DataType, Vararg{Any, N<:Any}}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n| `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Type{Base.IteratorsMD.CartesianIndex}, Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}}, UInt64}` | `Tuple{Type{Tuple{Type{Base.IteratorsMD.CartesianIndex}, Tuple{Vararg{Int64, N<:Any}}}}, UInt64}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N? |\n\n`jl_type_morespecific`:\nnone\n\n`type_match_`:\n\n| child | parent | morespecific | invariant | old result | new result | best |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `NTuple{#N<:Any, Int}` | `NTuple{#N<:Any, Integer}` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N |\n| `Tuple{Ptr{#T<:Any}, NTuple{#N<:Any, Int64}}` | `Tuple{Ptr{#T<:Any}, NTuple{#N<:Any, Integer}}` | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | N |\n\nNote that ~~in only one case does~~there are no cases where the result in current master seems to make more sense to me than the version here.

(IMO, kubectl should use dynamic client, and offload API-specific logic to the server.)\r\n\r\n**N.B.**\r\n- shared informers (pkg/controller/informers): shared informers are converted to use versioned API. However, plugin/pkg/admission also depends on the shared informers, and it keeps using internal API. So I have to manually add some internal version informers/listers to the shared informers. @ncdc is working on generating the shared informers, with bother internal version and external versions.\r\n- pkg/quota: @derekwaynecarr @vishh this package is depended by both plugin/pkg/admission and the pkg/controller, so I had to make a duplicate package, pkg/quotainternal, to be imported by the admission. I haven't thought this through: if we can remove `ResourceName` and `ResouceList` out of the API, we probably can avoid the duplicate\r\n- kubectl: kubectl uses several pkg/controller functions, mainly in pkg/controller/deployment/util, which are migrated to use versioned API, while kubectl still uses internal API. I have call to the conversion functions several times, to keep using the deployment controller utility functions. @janetkuo @pwittrock \r\n- Init containers: v1.Pod.Spec.InitContainers and v1.Pod.Status.InitContainerStatuses are not serialized. It used to rely on the conversion mechanism to encode/decode to the annotation fields. Kubelet now operates on v1.Pod and doesn't do any conversion, so I have to let kubelet explicitly write/read the annotations (see the changes in pkg/kubelet/config/apiserver.go and pkg/kubelet/status/status_manager.go) cc @smarterclayton \r\n- Copied some validation functions (159 lines) to pkg/v1/validation.\r\n**TODO**\r\n- I duplicated pkg/api/[pod, endpoints, service] in pkg/api/v1, need to check if the pkg/api ones are still needed.\r\n\r\ncc @liggitt @deads2k @bgrant0607 @mml @mbohlool  @kubernetes/sig-api-machinery \r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.kubernetes.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.kubernetes.io/reviews/kubernetes/kubernetes/36673)\r\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\r\n",

This is very easy to spot on the Unagi or GeeksPhone, but takes a large image (e.g. grab a 3 MB one from your photo camera) to see in the emulator.\n\nAfter quite some testing I tracked this down to the moment that the filter is applied (through WebGL, `gl.texImage2D` line). During this moment (which runs on the main thread, can't offload GL to a worker at the moment) the background images of the buttons disappear as well, even though there is no actual change on them. This is not only due to buttons or anything, but seem to happen on all background-images on the current view. Maybe a gecko flake or anything.\n\nI worked around the above by writing the image information to a canvas object embedded within the button, as an <img/> tag crashes B2G desktop there. This works great, the effects are also faster applied on the Unagi and no redraws are triggered. Also I now delay the rendering of these elements until the panel is actually used.\n",

The writable stream indicates that its buffer is full.\n2. This leads the readable stream to `pause()` and increase its `awaitDrain` counter, which will be decreased by the writable\u2019s next `drain` event.\n3. Something calls `.resume()` manually.\n4. The readable continues to pipe to the writable, but once again the writable stream indicates that the buffer is full.\n5. The `awaitDrain` counter is thus increased again, but since it has now been increased twice for a single piping destination, the next `drain` event will not be able to reset `awaitDrain` to zero.\n6. The pipe is stalled and no data is passed along anymore.\n\nThe solution in this commit is to reset the `awaitDrain` counter to zero when `resume()` is called.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7159\n\nThis bug is has been around at least since 0.12, and I don\u2019t currently know why it never popped up before #2325 when the `awaitDrain` mechanism worked like it does today.\n\n/cc @nodejs/streams \n",

I'm not sure how to deal with that.\n\nIn test/parallel/test-crypto.js the message is changed from \"asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag\" to \"asn1 encoding routines:asn1_check_tlen:wrong tag\".  (The function name in openssl got renamed from all capital letters to small letters.)\n\nIn test/parallel/test-tls-junk-server.js, the error message changed from \"/unknown protocol/\" to \"/wrong version number/\".\n\nIt also fixes 3 current issues with the test suite against the 1.0.2 version.\n\nWhen building against the 1.1.0 version there are various tests that fail.  There are a total of 11 test failures.\n\nSome tests assumes the TLS ticket is 48 bytes.  This was always just an implementation details and you could already ask OpenSSL what the size was.  The encryption got changed from AES128 to AES256 in 1.1.0 and so the size changed. I have no idea how to get that size to the right places in the test suite.\n\nSome of the other failures are related to ciphers that are disabled by default.  For instance anonymous ciphers like AECDH are disabled and you need to enable them by selecting a different security level, which can for instance be done by adding `@SECLEVEL=0` to the cipher list, but that's not compatible with the 1.0.x version.  Ciphers like 3DES and RC4 are disabled by default.\n\nOther tests fails because the key size that's used is too small.\n\nI'm not sure yet why some of the other tests fail.\n\nThere are also a bunch of warnings about deprecated functions.  I left them like they are.  The proper way to deal with it will probably break compatibility.\n\nPS: During make test I'm getting invalid opcode traps, this seems unrelated to my changes and doesn't seem to cause test suite failures.\n",

This introduced some overhead in doing certain operations, which I spent a lot of time optimizing away, further optimizations will come from cythonizing the core/internals, which should be straightforward at this point_\n\nHighlites below:\n\nIn 0.13.0 there is a major refactor primarily to subclass `Series` from `NDFrame`,\nwhich is the base class currently for `DataFrame` and `Panel`, to unify methods\nand behaviors. Series formerly subclassed directly from `ndarray`.\n- Refactor of series.py/frame.py/panel.py to move common code to generic.py\n  - added `_setup_axes` to created generic NDFrame structures\n  - moved methods\n    - `from_axes,_wrap_array,axes,ix,shape,empty,swapaxes,transpose,pop`\n    - `__iter__,keys,__contains__,__len__,__neg__,__invert__`\n    - `convert_objects,as_blocks,as_matrix,values`\n    - `__getstate__,__setstate__` (though compat remains in frame/panel)\n    - `__getattr__,__setattr__`\n    - `_indexed_same,reindex_like,align,where,mask,replace`\n    - `filter` (also added axis argument to selectively filter on a different axis)\n    - `reindex,reindex_axis` (which was the biggest change to make generic)\n    - `truncate` (moved to become part of `NDFrame`)\n- These are API changes which make `Panel` more consistent with `DataFrame`\n  - swapaxes on a Panel with the same axes specified now return a copy\n  - support attribute access for setting\n  - filter supports same api as original `DataFrame` filter\n- Reindex called with no arguments will now return a copy of the input object\n- Series now inherits from `NDFrame` rather than directly from `ndarray`.\n  There are several minor changes that affect the API.\n  - numpy functions that do not support the array interface will now\n    return `ndarrays` rather than series, e.g. `np.diff` and `np.where`\n  - `Series(0.5)` would previously return the scalar `0.5`, this is no\n    longer supported\n  - several methods from frame/series have moved to `NDFrame`\n    (convert_objects,where,mask)\n  - `TimeSeries` is now an alias for `Series`. the property `is_time_series`\n    can be used to distinguish (if desired)\n- Refactor of Sparse objects to use BlockManager\n  - Created a new block type in internals, `SparseBlock`, which can hold multi-dtypes\n    and is non-consolidatable. `SparseSeries` and `SparseDataFrame` now inherit\n    more methods from there hierarchy (Series/DataFrame), and no longer inherit\n    from `SparseArray` (which instead is the object of the `SparseBlock`)\n  - Sparse suite now supports integration with non-sparse data. Non-float sparse\n    data is supportable (partially implemented)\n  - Operations on sparse structures within DataFrames should preserve sparseness,\n    merging type operations will convert to dense (and back to sparse), so might\n    be somewhat inefficient\n  - enable setitem on `SparseSeries` for boolean/integer/slices\n  - `SparsePanels` implementation is unchanged (e.g. not using BlockManager, needs work)\n- added `ftypes` method to Series/DataFame, similar to `dtypes`, but indicates\n  if the underlying is sparse/dense (as well as the dtype)\n- All `NDFrame` objects now have a `_prop_attributes`, which can be used to indcated various\n  values to propogate to a new object from an existing (e.g. name in `Series` will follow\n  more automatically now)\n\nPerf changed a bit primarily in groupby where a Series has to be reconstructed in order to be passed to the function (in some cases). I basically pass a Series-like class to the grouped function to see if it doesn't raise, if its ok, then it is used rather than a full Series in order to reduce overhead of the Series creation for each group.\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngroupby_multi_python                         | 109.3636 |  78.3370 |   1.3961 |\nframe_iteritems                              |   3.4664 |   2.0154 |   1.7200 |\nframe_fancy_lookup                           |   3.3991 |   1.6137 |   2.1064 |\nsparse_frame_constructor                     |  11.7100 |   5.3363 |   2.1944 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTarget [c5d9495] : BUG: fix ujson handling of new series object\nBase   [1b91f4f] : BUG: Fixed non-unique indexing memory allocation issue with .ix/.loc (GH4280)\n```\n",

See issue #28718 and [its reproducable script]( https://gist.github.com/rafaelfranca/dd0a2d32397fd9c3a596a349e6601309) for an example.\r\n\r\nThis commit starts an attempt to clone values(allocate a separate object) for a new object. My reasoning behind this is that each object should have its own allocated values even if the contents of the value are the same for the two objects. While *car_1* and *car_2* may share the same name, they should not share the same String object for name.\r\n\r\nThis is a crude attempt at solving the issue by showing that the attributes passed in could be cloned before they are saved to the new object.

      "pr2.desc": "This is a first cut at a simple patch that allows developers to protect certain serialized columns from being written to the database on every update. The default behavior is not affected and this patch is 100% backwards compatible.  Quick example:\n\n``` ruby\nclass MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  # some_field gets written on every write\n  serialize :field1\n  # same as above\n  serialize :field2, dirty: :always\n  serialize :field3, Object, dirty: :always\n\n  # field4 only gets written, if\n  # field4_will_change was called\n  serialize :field4, dirty: :never\nend\n```\n\nThe current second argument, `class_name`, still works and is optional as well.\n\nThis patch fixes #8328 in a very lightweight way. If this gets any interest, I'd love to discuss\n\n 1) Allowing values `:clone` and `:hash` to the dirty option. This would store a hash or copy of the object after initialization and compare it when saving. This is rather expensive so it has to be strictly opt-in.\n\n 2) Consolidating the existing `serialized_attributes` and the new `serialized_attribute_options` class attributes. IMO it would be nice to have something like `MyModel.serialized_attribute_options == {my_field: {dirty: :always, coder: XXX}}`. This could be implemented by first deprecating `serialized_attributes` in case somebody is directly using it. It may even make sense to simplify the `serialize` method more, by making the current `class_name` argument a part of the options hash\n\nI've never attempted to contribute to rails, so forgive my ignorance wrt process. I'm also more than happy to change the naming, formatting and structure of the code as needed. I'll also write some specs (I already wrote some but wasn't able to run them... :().\n\nBrief rationale: Consider a system with two separate processes `A` and `B`. `A` reads your model object, does something for a second and then call save on it. Whatever your serialized column's value was when `A` read it is now written to the database. In the meantime, `B` might have modified that column. Those changes are now lost.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "Per the top level comment:\n\nA low-level utility for more ergonomically allocating, reallocating, and deallocating a\na buffer of memory on the heap without having to worry about all the corner cases\ninvolved. This type is excellent for building your own data structures like Vec and VecDeque.\nIn particular:\n- Produces heap::EMPTY on zero-sized types\n- Produces heap::EMPTY on zero-length allocations\n- Catches all overflows in capacity computations (promotes them to \"capacity overflow\" panics)\n- Guards against 32-bit systems allocating more than isize::MAX bytes\n- Guards against overflowing your length\n- Aborts on OOM\n- Avoids freeing heap::EMPTY\n- Contains a ptr::Unique and thus endows the user with all related benefits\n\nThis type does not in anyway inspect the memory that it manages. When dropped it _will_\nfree its memory, but it _won't_ try to Drop its contents. It is up to the user of RawVec\nto handle the actual things _stored_ inside of a RawVec.\n\nNote that a RawVec always forces its capacity to be usize::MAX for zero-sized types.\nThis enables you to use capacity growing logic catch the overflows in your length\nthat might occur with zero-sized types.\n\nHowever this means that you need to be careful when roundtripping this type\nwith a `Box<[T]>`: `cap()` won't yield the len. However `with_capacity`,\n`shrink_to_fit`, and `from_box` will actually set RawVec's private capacity\nfield. This allows zero-sized types to not be special-cased by consumers of\nthis type.\n\nEdit: \nfixes #18726 and fixes #23842\n",

Colour brewing is done manually so the only additional import required is `numpy`, and output is still pure dot format. \n\nEnhancements include:\n- Drawing leaf nodes at the base of the tree for clarity\n- Colours indicating how the node classification is 'leaning', including multi-class\n- Percentage samples shown in node instead of raw number of samples\n- Percentage per class shown for all nodes, not just leaves\n\nStandard output, omitting the new `pretty` and `simple` flags, should result in the exact same graphical output from Graphviz as the incumbent version, though the dot code has been altered slightly for simplicity given the new more complicated node representation for `pretty`.\n\nA few examples using the Titanic survivor dataset:\n\nno flags:\n\n![full_new](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514716/0a8c122a-4b88-11e4-92dd-78f78bbfcee9.png)\n\n`pretty`:\n\n![full_pretty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514717/154df71e-4b88-11e4-9d09-b763ebe63763.png)\n\n`pretty` & `simple`:\n\n![full_pretty_simple](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514718/20512c9e-4b88-11e4-88f7-6eb78fabec4d.png)\n\n`pretty` & `max_depth`:\n\n![cropped_pretty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514721/3957a330-4b88-11e4-9544-78f68cab3da5.png)\n\nIt has been moderately tested on pure `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` objects, though I am well aware that regression needs work and will fail if attempted with the new flags (though the standard output still appears to be functional).\n\nTo be discussed:\n- How to represent colours for regression... I'm thinking a diverging colour scheme with white for the median or mean of the two most extreme values in the leaves should work well.\n- Should the text and graphical options be broken out further? Something like `show_major_class`, `use_colours`, `use_percentages`, etc., or some perhaps discarded. I based the options off the R package, that's not meant to imply that this is the state of the art, just the best I've stumbled across.\n- Should the base implementation even be maintained? The extra sub-tree recursion per node is a little expensive, but it's just a single tree... And seeing what each node is voting towards gives more intuitive information than the error coefficients alone. It even appears that this used to be standard output from the examples [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)\n\nOther options that might be useful:\n- Left to right orientation for use in reports?\n- Anything else you can think of? Though Graphviz is a little limited in what you can pull off\n- Welcome any other suggestions / gotchas\n",

Bootstrapping\nfrom a previously stable release is a long-desired feature of distros because\nthey're not fans of downloading binary stage0 blobs from us. Additionally, this\nmakes our own CI easier as we can decommission all of the snapshot builders and\nstart having a regular cadence to when we update the stage0 compiler.\n\nA new `src/etc/get-stage0.py` script was added which shares some code with\n`src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py` to read a new file, `src/stage0.txt`, which lists\nthe current stage0 compiler as well as cargo that we bootstrap from. This script\nwill download the relevant `rustc` package an unpack it into `$target/stage0` as\nwe do today.\n\nOne problem of bootstrapping from stable releases is that we're not able to\ncompile unstable code (e.g. all the `#![feature]` directives in libcore/libstd).\nTo overcome this we employ two strategies:\n- The bootstrap key of the previous compiler is hardcoded into `src/stage0.txt`\n  (enabled as a result of #32731) and exported by the build system. This enables\n  nightly features in the compiler we download.\n- The standard library and compiler are pinned to a specific stage0, which\n  doesn't change, so we're guaranteed that we'll continue compiling as we start\n  from a known fixed source.\n\nThe process for making a release will also need to be tweaked now to continue to\ncadence of bootstrapping from the previous release. This process looks like:\n1. Merge `beta` to `stable`\n2. Produce a new stable compiler.\n3. Change `master` to bootstrap from this new stable compiler.\n4. Merge `master` to `beta`\n5. Produce a new beta compiler\n6. Change `master` to bootstrap from this new beta compiler.\n\nStep 3 above should involve very few changes as `master` was previously\nbootstrapping from `beta` which is the same as `stable` at that point in time.\nStep 6, however, is where we benefit from removing lots of `#[cfg(stage0)]` and\nget to use new features. This also shouldn't slow the release too much as steps\n1-5 requires little work other than waiting and step 6 just needs to happen at\nsome point during a release cycle, it's not time sensitive.\n\nCloses #29555\nCloses #29557\n",

Explain your changes.\n\nWhen running a 'diag' GMM on a high-dimensional feature space, a Memory Error was thrown. This is suspicious because quadratic memory should not be used for diagonal GMM fitting. Indeed, there was a section of gmm.py that had a needless covariance matrix calculation for the 'diag' and 'spherical' cases.\n\nThe modified code fixes that; behavior should be the same for 'diag'.\n\nFor 'spherical', the previous code initialized the variance term to the average value of all terms in the covariance matrix. The new code CHANGES this behavior; now it is the average value of the diagonal terms only. This is a more appropriate initialization anyway.\n#### Any other comments?\n\n<!--\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

      "pr2.desc": "While our last major version bump (2.0) was a complete rewrite of the docs, CSS, and JavaScript, the move to 3.0 is equally ambitious, but for a different reason: **Bootstrap 3 will be mobile-first.** This is an ongoing document to identify the changes we'll be making along the way.\n## Docs and repo\n\nWe'll be working to simplify the content of the docs once again. Key changes are around the organization of the pages and the tools powering them.\n#### Repository\n- [x] **Add new `dist` folder.**\n  - Includes two subfolders, `css` and `js`, each containing a regular and minified version of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.\n- [x] **Separate dependencies from compiled Bootstrap files** with new `assets` folder.\n  - All files within `assets` are documentation assets or third party dependencies.\n- [x] **Switch from Makefile to Grunt.**\n  - Grunt is JavaScript-based\n  - Helps folks who want to run and compile Bootstrap locally on Windows\n  - Replaces all existing `make` commands with `grunt` commands (all the same functionality, just a different tool)\n#### General docs changes\n- [x] **Convert docs to Jekyll.** \n  - Instead of Mustache, docs templates are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).\n  - This greatly simplifies deploying docs changes, isolates our docs from CSS and JavaScript changes, and drastically decreases the amount of code being tracked in the repo.\n  - It also provides better URLs, page title variables, partials, and code highlighting.\n  - New repo structure\n- [x] **Host previous versions of documentation.**\n  - Instead of having folks download release tags, we'll go back and add the docs for the most recent version (2.3.2) to the site. They'll be available at http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ once v3 goes live.\n- [x] **Move examples to separate repo.**\n  - Fitting with our theme of focus and simplicity in the repo, we're moving all the example templates out into their own repository at [twbs/bootstrap-examples](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-examples).\n  - This keeps the examples as static files without a Jekyll server in the way, so more folks have easy access to them.\n  - It also removes a ton of static files (the example screenshots) from the repo and that's a huge win.\n- [x] **Add \"Customizing Bootstrap\" section** to detail best practices for customizing CSS.\n- [x] **Remove all i18n tags from Mustache templates.** No more `{{_i}}` and `{{/i}}` in the docs templates, just raw HTML in our Mustache files.\n- [x] **Remove Extend page** because it's content was not directly applicable to Bootstrap and out of date with info in the readme and Getting Started page.\n#### Homepage\n- [x] Point link to the new [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com).\n- [x] Remove examples and basically all marketing content from homepage.\n#### Getting started\n- [x] Add Bower installation instructions to guide.\n- [x] Add new Customization best practices section.\n## Global JavaScript\n- [x] Overhaul CSS transitions and reinforce with JavaScript transitions as necessary.\n- [x] Improve noConflict throughout plugins.\n- [x] Namespace events to reduce conflict issues.\n- [x] **Drop bootstrap-typeahead.js.**\n  - For context, see #7805 & https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/88dd9de9bad56b30a12466477a810c78648200c9.\n  - Instead, use [Twitter's typeahead.js plugin](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/).\n## Global CSS\n\nAt a high level, we're dropping IE7 and FF3.6 support, combining standard and responsive CSS into a single file, and consolidating additional code as appropriate.\n### Browser support\n- [x] **Drop support for IE7.** Removed all `*` hacks, such as `*zoom: 1;`, and other IE7-specific lines of CSS.\n- [x] **Drop support for Firefox 3.6.** Removed `-moz-box-shadow` instances and related hacks.\n### LESS changes\n- [x] **Refactor most components to be more mixin-friendly.**\n  - Instead of all component classes being a hodgepodge of un-nested CSS, we'll re-order the code to make it super easy to take any Bootstrap class and use it as a mixin.\n  - Not all components have been rewritten this way, but those that make sense to rename have.\n- [x] **Rename variables to use dashes** instead of camelCase. For example, it's now `@body-bg` instead of `@bodyBackground`.\n- [x] **More consistent variable naming scheme.**\n  - The format of variables was all over the place and has now been standardized.\n  - The general approach is element, state, pseudo state. For example, `@navbar-link-color-hover`.\n- [x] **Replace existing color variables with more semantic ones.**\n  - No more `@blue`, `@orange`, and the like, which we weren't using them much anyway.\n  - They've been replaced with `@brand-primary`, `@brand-success`, and others. These are then assigned on a per-component basis (e.g., `@state-warning-text`, `@btn-background-primary`, etc).\n  - Also removed `@black` and `@white` because `#000` and `#fff` are 20% shorter and not something that should be controlled via variable.\n- [x] **Remove `.border-radius()` and `.border-*-*-radius` mixins.** \n  - As only Android 2.1, iOS 3.2, and older desktop browsers [require a prefixed version](http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius), we've removed the base mixin. Since we no longer require prefixes for independent corners, we've dropped those mixins as well. Mixins for a single side, like `.border-left-radius`, are still available.\n- [x] **Use decimal values in `.opacity()` mixin instead of whole numbers** to match default CSS patterns. \n  - For example, write `.opacity(.5)` instead of `.opacity(50)`.\n- [x] **Add retina image mixin.** Declare a standard and 2x image path and set the size for easy retina images anywhere with `.img-retina()`.\n- [x] **Add new global `@component-active-bg` variable.**\n  - Instead of assigning `@link-color` to multiple variables for backgrounds, we have dedicated a new variable to that.\n  - Change `@component-active-bg` and customize the active states of nav pills, dropdowns, and more.\n- [x] **Update gradient mixins for better color stop support.**\n  - Vertical and horizontal gradients now accept four values, in the following order: `@start-color`, `@start-percent`, `@end-color`, and `@end-percent`.\n  - Upgrading means specifying all four values in the above order, or specifying variables directly when calling your mixins.\n  - To call a gradient but only set two properties, directly assign values to the variables like so: `#gradient > .vertical(@start-color: red; @end-color: blue);`. Doing so will include the default values for any unmentioned variables.\n- [x] **Drop unused prefixes from several mixins.**\n  - See https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/8380 for more information.\n### Miscellaneous\n- [x] **Go mobile first.** Responsive CSS is no longer separate and all responsive features are now compiled into the core `bootstrap.css` file near. Separate files are no longer required, and have thus been removed.\n- [x] **Upgrade to latest Normalize, and removed reset.less.** \n  - This includes removing reset.less in favor of a dedicated normalize.less file. \n  - Print styles and responsive image CSS (the only meaningful modifications from the previous reset file) have been moved to print.less and scaffolding.less, respectfully.\n- [x] **Moved print styles to separate print.less file.**\n  - Previously print styles were bundled with the scaffolding.less page.\n  - Now within a separate file for easy removal via the Customizer.\n- [x] **Remove layouts.less.** \n  - Since it only held a couple layout styles and the fluid container has been removed (see next section), this file is superfluous. \n  - We've moved the default `.container` styles to `grid.less`.\n- [x] **Add `!important` to `.hide` and `.show`.** \n  - For these classes to work on every element, the specificity either needed to be higher or we needed the `!important` flag. We opted for the latter for fewer lines of code.\n- [x] **Drop `*-important` for `.*-danger`.** \n  - Some elements had red variations that came from different class naming schemes, so we standardized that by switching all red variations to `*-danger`. \n  - Includes buttons, labels, badges, text, alerts. and progress bars.\n- [x] Refactor responsive utility classes to match new media queries.\n## Grid system\n\nThe grid is drastically simpler, yet more powerful, in BS3. We're transitions back to a single grid system, but with all the awesomeness that was present in the old grids. On top of that, we've also added some new features.\n- [x] **Overhaul grid systems to make it fluid and mobile-first.**\n  - Removed the separate fluid grid system, container, and layout as we're down to one grid.\n  - New single grid system (still uses `.row`) utilizes percentages over pixels, `padding` instead of `margin`, and `box-sizing: border-box` for easy math.\n  - The grid is mobile first, meaning it starts out stacked and scales up as necessary to become horizontal via media queries. Previously the grid was built for 940px layouts and scaled up and down.\n  - Nesting is still 100% supported, but columns will be proportionately sized to their parent, just as the old fluid grid behaved.\n  - Offsets are still 100% supported.\n- [x] **Increase specificity of grid classes.**\n  - Instead of `.span*` and `.offset*`, we're now using `.col-*` and `.col-offset-*`, respectively.\n- [x] **Add tiny and small grid systems for phones and tablets.**\n  - Similar to the default grid system, we've added two more sets of grid classes to create more complex layouts for phones and tablets. That means you can optionally utilize 12 columns at two additional important breakpoints.\n  - Use `.col-*` classes for tiny devices (smartphones).\n  - Use `.col-sm-*` classes for small devices (tablets).\n  - The small grid classes also include support for offsets and source ordering, but the tiny grid classes do not.\n- [x] **Simplify required grid variables.**\n  - The `@grid-row-width` and `@grid-column-width` variables have been removed. We didn't use the row width (`@gridRowWidth` as of v2.3.1) variable anywhere in the source and column widths are now derived via simple calculations in our LESS.\n  - We've added a new `@grid-float-breakpoint` variable to customize the point at which the floats and widths kick in for our new mobile-first grid.\n- [x] **New and improved grid mixins.**\n  - Changed `.makeRow()` to `.make-row()`.\n  - Changed `.makeColumn()` to `.make-column()`. In addition, it includes a media query to apply the `float` and `width` when above the `@grid-float-breakpoint` value.\n  - Added `.make-column-offset()` to generate column gaps, similar to the predefined grid classes.\n- [x] **Add `.col-push-*` and `.col-pull-*` modifier classes** for easy column source ordering.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated table grid classes.**\n  - They are no longer necessary given the new grid.\n  - However, we are still removing the float on `.col-*` classes when used within `.table` elements.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated input grid classes.**\n  - Remove input grid mixin and input span classes.\n  - Given new grid system, inputs are always `width: 100%;` to start.\n  - Best practices now are to place 100% wide inputs _within_ grid columns as opposed to using classes directly on input elements.\n- [x] Use `max-width` instead of `width` on all `.container` instances to help prevent some issues with containers in components like navbars.\n## Type\n\nTypography in Bootstrap 3 isn't seeing much change, just a decent amount of cleanup and some small improvements.\n#### Headings\n- [x] Add support for headings classes (e.g., `h1, .h1 { \u2026 }`).\n- [x] Remove `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` from headings to prevent (inconsistent) broken rendering on some Android and Windows devices.\n#### Lists\n- [x] Change `ul.unstyled` to `.list-unstyled`.\n  - No longer dependent on HTML element in the selector.\n  - Can now be used as mixin.\n- [x] Change `ul.inline` to `.list-inline`.\n  - Uses `.list-unstyled` as a mixin to reset default list styles.\n  - Can now be used as a mixin.\n#### Text classes\n- [x] **Changed `.muted` to `.text-muted`** to match the other contextual text colors.\n- [x] Fixed bug with text alignment utility classes and tables.\n#### LESS\n- [x] Remove all `#font` mixins.\n  - We only used these in one place and they honestly just complicated things.\n  - Instead of using mixins, just make use of the `@font-family-` variables.\n- [x] Drop the `@altFontFamily` variable.\n\nWe explored the use of rem units over pixels, but found little benefit to offset the implications of their use. IE8 would still need a pixel fallback, and that's a lot of duplicate lines of code. Moreover, using rems everywhere instead of pixels would exacerbate that problem. Mixing rems and pixels doesn't seem to make sense either right now. However, we can and will continue to evaluate this in future releases.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add support for responsive utility classes on table elements.**\n- [x] Remove `table.info` from table state classes.\n- [x] Added global `text-align: left;` for `<th>` elements (to undo the default center alignment) and removed `font-weight: bold;` from them (bold is a browser default).\n- [x] Improve nesting by scoping all styles to immediate children.\n  - Using the `>` selector, we scope all styles.\n  - Doesn't change much, but does mean you'll need to apply the table classes to all nested tables.\n## Images\n- [x] **Consolidate image thumbnail styles.** No more `.img-polaroid` as it duplicated the same styles as `.thumbnail`. Now you can use `.img-thumbnail` for regular inline(-block) images, or `.thumbnail` for composite components.\n## Buttons\n\nFewer, but better buttons. They're redesigned and we're removing some from the mix because they have no clear and universal semantic purpose.\n- [x] **Default button now requires `.btn-default` class.**\n  - The default gray button requires two classes\u2014`class=\"btn btn-default\"`.\n  - This better matches all our other buttons as well.\n  - We tried to remove the `.btn` class as well, but given the CSS for creating button groups and dropdowns, it's much simpler to keep it around.\n  - While it does add an extra class, it's specificity great simplifies customization methods in plain CSS, and even more so when extending those classes with LESS mixins.\n- [x] **Drop `.btn-inverse`.**\n  - There _really_ is no semantic reasoning for having it, so it's gone.\n- [x] Revamp some of the aesthetics of the buttons (no more outer box-shadow) by default.\n- [x] **Simplify button mixins and pseudo states.**\n  - Removed the `.buttonBackground()` mixin since it was no longer in use.\n  - Added the `.btn-pseudo-states()` mixin for setting button `background-color` and `border-color` for the default and `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and various `disabled` states.\n- [x] **Add justified button group option for link buttons.**\n  - This feature is only available for buttons with link tags, e.g. `<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn\">Button</a>`, and is not compatible with the `<button>` element due to some browser lame-itude that keeps buttons from accepting auto widths on `table-cell` buttons.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add `.active` contextual class.**\n  - Applies the table hover `background-color` to any row or cell that gets the `.active` class.\n- [x] Allow contextual classes to be applied to `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` cells.\n## Forms\n\nForm controls are now 100% width by default, input groups have been overhauled, and form states simplified.\n- [x] **Update box model for inputs.** \n  - Switched to `box-sizing: border-box;` and `width: 100%;` by default for all textual inputs.\n  - This means you'll need to specify a size for inputs, whereas before 3.0 inputs had a set pixel width (around 220px) to start.\n- [x] **Remove `input-prepend` and `input-append` for singular `.input-group`.** The classes have changed for the elements within, and require a bit more markup to use buttons.\n  - Use `.input-group` as the parent class around the input and addon.\n  - For text based prepends/appends, use `.input-group-addon`  instead of `.addon`.\n  - For button prepends/appends, use `.input-group-btn` and place your `.btn` **within** that element.\n- [x] **Drop `.form-search`.**\n- [x] **Add support for `fieldset[disabled]`.** All form controls within a `<fieldset>` with the `disabled` attribute will be styled appropriately.\n- [x] **Drop `cursor: pointer;` from labels** and instead only set them on checkbox and radio label options.\n- [x] **Drop `.controls-row` for grid inputs.** \n  - Given input elements in 3.0 are set to `width: 100%` by default, and since we don't want to implement a separate input grid, we've opted to drop the `.controls-row` functionality.\n  - Instead, folks should wrap inputs in standard grid markup: with a wrapping `.row` and individual `.span*` columns around each input.\n- [x] **Drop `.input-block-level` mixin and class.** \n  - Since inputs are already `width: 100%;`, this is redundant. \n  - **Note:** inputs are still `display: inline-block`, so if you absolutely need them to be block level, you'll need to independently set that yourself.\n- [x] **Drop the `.uneditable-input` control.** Instead, use a read-only input if you must.\n- [x] **Drop `.inline-help` option.**\n- [x] **Horizontal forms are now mobile-first**, meaning at <768px, elements are stacked. Above that, elements are floated and appear side-by-side.\n- [x] **Checkboxes and radios now require an extra `<div>`.** \n  - Instead of `label.checkbox`, you'll need `div.checkbox` with a `<label>` within. \n  - This was done to tighten up the clickable area around labels and avoid potential misclicks.\n- [x] **New classes for inline radios and checkboxes.** \n  - Instead of `.radio.inline`, you now need a single class, `.radio-inline`, for direct use on a `<label>` element. \n  - To be clear, inline radios and checkboxes do not need a wrapping `<div>`, but the default stacked ones do.\n- [x] Added new placeholder syntax to the `.placeholder()` mixin for Firefox 19+.\n- [x] **Drop `.help-inline`.**\n  - Given the 100% wide inputs and focus on mobile, inline help text makes much less sense.\n  - Block help text via `.help-block` remains.\n## Icons\n- [x] **Convert to Glyphicons font and move to separate repository.**\n  - Convert to Glyphicons v1.7 @font-face and drop the old PNGs.\n- [x] **Change required base class and prefix.** \n  - Instead of using an attribute selector, like `[class^=\"glyphicon-\"]`, we now require a base class, `.glyphicon`.\n  - This improves general performance for larger pages while also increasing the durability of our code (as it doesn't enforce a specific order of classes). \n  - This is in addition to the prefix class (which has also been udpated).\n  - All classes start with `.glyphicon-` instead of `.icon-` for a more unique class and consistency with the newly required base class.\n## Responsive utilities\n- [x] Refactor responsive-utilities.less to use new mobile-first approach.\n- [x] Update the docs to reflect the changes in media queries used.\n## Button groups\n- [x] **Add support for dropdowns in button groups (or, nested button groups).**\n- [x] **Update checkbox and radio variations to use form controls.**\n  - Checkbox and radio button groups now use `<input>`s in their markup.\n## Labels and badges\n\nWe have differentiated the labels and badges with v3. The gist is that badges no longer have modifier classes and are purely meant as unread counters.\n- [x] Dropped all modifier variations on badges, making it as neutral as possible, much like those of Mail.app on OS X.\n- [x] Dropped the `.label-inverse` variation (in conjunction with the inverse button being removed).\n- [x] Refactor labels to scale with their parent's `font-size`.\n## Jumbotron (formly hero unit)\n- [x] **Class changed** from `.hero-unit` to `.jumbotron`. Associated variables have also been updated to match.\n- [x] **Lighter `font-weight` for headings**. Uses semibold instead of bold for headings.\n- [x] **Scale `font-size`** in responsive views.\n- [x] Now full-width without rounded corners to in mobile viewports.\n- [x] Improved type styles\u2014now it starts with normal heading sizes and scales to larger sizes given a larger viewport.\n## Breadcrumbs\n- [x] Remove the trailing `/` from the last item.\n## Navigation\n#### Navs\n- [x] **Remove `.nav-list` option**. Replaced by the new `.list-group` component.\n- [x] **Remove tabs on left, right, and bottom.** \n  - Tabs on the left and right, while occasionally useful, have been removed from our CSS.\n  - You can still use the JavaScript plugin and custom CSS to make left/right tabs, but we will no longer include those in the core.\n- [x] **Removed parent `<div>` in the pagination component** and **dropped center and right alignment options**. See #6562 for context.\n#### Navbars\n- [x] **Drop support for `.navbar-search`.** We dropped the `.navbar-search` form layout, so it doesn't make sense to have this anymore. Also, this is just a _slightly_ fancier `.navbar-form`, which we plan on keeping.\n- [x] **Overhaul styles of default navbar** and its sub-components:\n  - Dropdown menu carets (those attached to the actual menu, not the indicators) have been removed so that dropdown menus sit flat against the edge of the navbar.\n  - Navbar vertical dividers have been brought in a smidge, meaning they do not extend the full height of the navbar.\n  - No more box-shadow or gradients on the navbars.\n  - Height of navbar has increased from 44px to 62px for mobile devices, and 50px for desktops.\n- [x] **Removed `.navbar-inner`** and moved relevant styles to `.navbar`. The inner div is no longer required, greatly simplifying our shit.\n- [x] **Changed `.navbar > .nav` to `.navbar-nav`.**\n- [x] **Change `.btn-navbar` to `.navbar-toggle`.**\n  - More consistent naming schema\n  - Redesigned it a bit, lightening the styles and widening it, while also positioning it absolutely to the top right.\n- [x] **Updated navbar brand component:**\n  - Changed `.brand` to `.navbar-brand` for a more consistent naming schema.\n  - Center aligned `.navbar-brand` in mobile views, with a `max-width: 200px;` to limit hit area given a likely navbar toggle will be very near by.\n- [x] **Dropped navbar dividers.**\n- [x] **Added support for disabled nav links.**\n  - Includes new variables like `@navbar-link-color-disabled` and `@navbar-link-bg-disabled`, along with the inverse options.\n#### Dropdowns\n- [x] **Remove submenus** suport in dropdown menus.\n- [x] Removed `.nav-header` and replaced with `.dropdown-header` on account of no more `.nav-list` and that dropdowns still benefit from section headings.\n## Progress bars\n- [x] **Add variables for background colors.** Instead of hard-coded (and different) green, red, yellow, and blue colors, we use the new (more semantic) global colors.\n- [x] **Refactor progress bar classes** for simpler CSS.\n  - New structure is now `.progress` on the outer `<div>` and `.progress-bar` on the inner `<div>`.\n  - Instead of placing modifier classes on the parent, they are placed directly on the bars (e.g., `.progress-bar-info`) in addition to the required `.progress-bar` class.\n## Modals\n- [x] **No longer require use of `.hide`.** We updated the utility classes to use `!important` and to avoid clashing, removed the `.hide` class from modals. Now `display: none;` is set directly in the modals.less file. **When upgrading, be sure to remove the `.hide` class from existing modals.**\n- [x] **Redesign the modals to be mobile-first.**\n  - As BS3 is mobile-first, this new modal also starts at the mobile level and scales up via media queries.\n  - Reintroduces `.modal-open` on the body (so we can nuke the scroll there)\n  - Adds a couple extra levels of markup (namely `.modal-dialog` and `.modal-content`) so we can scroll the entire modal rather than overflow a section within the modal.\n  - Related, `.modal` is now the wrapper, and `.modal-content` is the modal itself. This is so we can still use `position: fixed;`, but make the modal relatively positioned so that scrolling moves the entire modal, not something with it.\n  - Added a `.modal-title` for more consistent and useful targeting of the heading content (previously this was just an `<h3>` and selector performance wise that sucked).\n- [ ] **Test on iOS5.** Not sure if we need to go older, but I want to check here to see how well fixed is supported.\n- [ ] **Test on Android devices** (including native browser and Chrome). I only have a year-old Nexus lying around, so might need help tracking down bugs on older devices.\n- [ ] **Add option to programmatically set width** of the modal.\n- [ ] Prevent `<body>` scrollbar and shifting content with `overflow: hidden;`.\n## Thumbnails\n- [x] **Drop the `.thumbnails` meta component.** Instead of special HTML and CSS for grid sizing, just use the grid system itself. Individual `.thumbnail` styles are still available, but for sizing, require a parent with a set `width` (e.g., grid columns).\n## Alerts\n- [x] `<hr>` elements within any `.alert` component will now be styled to match the border color of the alert.\n- [x] Immediate children links within default alerts, and within paragraph text, are now styled for improved readability. Links are automatically bolded and appear as a slightly darker color than the alert text.\n## New: List groups\n\nAdded a new component, the list group, for creating simple and complex series of components. Perfect for more complex implementations like email inboxes, or simple ones like a list of options.\n- Requires `.list-group` as a parent base class (on a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<div>`)\n- Requires  `.list-group-item` for individual list items\n- List items can also be easily linked\u2014just change from `<ul class=\"list-group\">` and `<li class=\"list-group-item\">` to `<div class=\"list-group\">` and `<a class=\"list-group-item\">`.\n- Option: include a badge, chevron, or both to any list item for automatic placement.\n- Option: use `.list-group-item-heading` and `.list-group-item-text` for custom content implementations.\n\n**Linked list groups replace the nav list component.**\n\nList groups can also be used within panels with the `.list-group-flush` class to take them the full width of the parent panel.\n## New: Panels\n\nAdded a new component, the panel, for easily containing content within a box with an optional heading. Also included are contextual state classes for success, warning, danger, and info.\n## Tooltips\n- [x] Bump font-size from 11px to 12px.\n## Carousel\n- [x] **Redesign!** Lighter styles for the previous and next controls, as well as the carousel captions.\n- [x] **Update required markup for carousel controls.** The `.carousel-control` class now requires another element within it for the previous/next characters. Those characters are now Glyhpicons icons for improved styling and positioning across browsers and devices.\n- [x] **Indicators are now bottom-middle aligned.**\n- [x] **Captions are reinforced as optional** and, by default, are hidden on mobile views, then shown for >768px viewports.\n## Customizer\n- [x] Redesign the entire thing.\n- [ ] Highlight dependencies between components and assets.\n- [ ] Figure out how to load and download the same customizations.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "While our last major version bump (2.0) was a complete rewrite of the docs, CSS, and JavaScript, the move to 3.0 is equally ambitious, but for a different reason: **Bootstrap 3 will be mobile-first.** This is an ongoing document to identify the changes we'll be making along the way.\n## Docs and repo\n\nWe'll be working to simplify the content of the docs once again. Key changes are around the organization of the pages and the tools powering them.\n#### Repository\n- [x] **Add new `dist` folder.**\n  - Includes two subfolders, `css` and `js`, each containing a regular and minified version of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.\n- [x] **Separate dependencies from compiled Bootstrap files** with new `assets` folder.\n  - All files within `assets` are documentation assets or third party dependencies.\n- [x] **Switch from Makefile to Grunt.**\n  - Grunt is JavaScript-based\n  - Helps folks who want to run and compile Bootstrap locally on Windows\n  - Replaces all existing `make` commands with `grunt` commands (all the same functionality, just a different tool)\n#### General docs changes\n- [x] **Convert docs to Jekyll.** \n  - Instead of Mustache, docs templates are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).\n  - This greatly simplifies deploying docs changes, isolates our docs from CSS and JavaScript changes, and drastically decreases the amount of code being tracked in the repo.\n  - It also provides better URLs, page title variables, partials, and code highlighting.\n  - New repo structure\n- [x] **Host previous versions of documentation.**\n  - Instead of having folks download release tags, we'll go back and add the docs for the most recent version (2.3.2) to the site. They'll be available at http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ once v3 goes live.\n- [x] **Move examples to separate repo.**\n  - Fitting with our theme of focus and simplicity in the repo, we're moving all the example templates out into their own repository at [twbs/bootstrap-examples](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-examples).\n  - This keeps the examples as static files without a Jekyll server in the way, so more folks have easy access to them.\n  - It also removes a ton of static files (the example screenshots) from the repo and that's a huge win.\n- [x] **Add \"Customizing Bootstrap\" section** to detail best practices for customizing CSS.\n- [x] **Remove all i18n tags from Mustache templates.** No more `{{_i}}` and `{{/i}}` in the docs templates, just raw HTML in our Mustache files.\n- [x] **Remove Extend page** because it's content was not directly applicable to Bootstrap and out of date with info in the readme and Getting Started page.\n#### Homepage\n- [x] Point link to the new [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com).\n- [x] Remove examples and basically all marketing content from homepage.\n#### Getting started\n- [x] Add Bower installation instructions to guide.\n- [x] Add new Customization best practices section.\n## Global JavaScript\n- [x] Overhaul CSS transitions and reinforce with JavaScript transitions as necessary.\n- [x] Improve noConflict throughout plugins.\n- [x] Namespace events to reduce conflict issues.\n- [x] **Drop bootstrap-typeahead.js.**\n  - For context, see #7805 & https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/88dd9de9bad56b30a12466477a810c78648200c9.\n  - Instead, use [Twitter's typeahead.js plugin](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/).\n## Global CSS\n\nAt a high level, we're dropping IE7 and FF3.6 support, combining standard and responsive CSS into a single file, and consolidating additional code as appropriate.\n### Browser support\n- [x] **Drop support for IE7.** Removed all `*` hacks, such as `*zoom: 1;`, and other IE7-specific lines of CSS.\n- [x] **Drop support for Firefox 3.6.** Removed `-moz-box-shadow` instances and related hacks.\n### LESS changes\n- [x] **Refactor most components to be more mixin-friendly.**\n  - Instead of all component classes being a hodgepodge of un-nested CSS, we'll re-order the code to make it super easy to take any Bootstrap class and use it as a mixin.\n  - Not all components have been rewritten this way, but those that make sense to rename have.\n- [x] **Rename variables to use dashes** instead of camelCase. For example, it's now `@body-bg` instead of `@bodyBackground`.\n- [x] **More consistent variable naming scheme.**\n  - The format of variables was all over the place and has now been standardized.\n  - The general approach is element, state, pseudo state. For example, `@navbar-link-color-hover`.\n- [x] **Replace existing color variables with more semantic ones.**\n  - No more `@blue`, `@orange`, and the like, which we weren't using them much anyway.\n  - They've been replaced with `@brand-primary`, `@brand-success`, and others. These are then assigned on a per-component basis (e.g., `@state-warning-text`, `@btn-background-primary`, etc).\n  - Also removed `@black` and `@white` because `#000` and `#fff` are 20% shorter and not something that should be controlled via variable.\n- [x] **Remove `.border-radius()` and `.border-*-*-radius` mixins.** \n  - As only Android 2.1, iOS 3.2, and older desktop browsers [require a prefixed version](http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius), we've removed the base mixin. Since we no longer require prefixes for independent corners, we've dropped those mixins as well. Mixins for a single side, like `.border-left-radius`, are still available.\n- [x] **Use decimal values in `.opacity()` mixin instead of whole numbers** to match default CSS patterns. \n  - For example, write `.opacity(.5)` instead of `.opacity(50)`.\n- [x] **Add retina image mixin.** Declare a standard and 2x image path and set the size for easy retina images anywhere with `.img-retina()`.\n- [x] **Add new global `@component-active-bg` variable.**\n  - Instead of assigning `@link-color` to multiple variables for backgrounds, we have dedicated a new variable to that.\n  - Change `@component-active-bg` and customize the active states of nav pills, dropdowns, and more.\n- [x] **Update gradient mixins for better color stop support.**\n  - Vertical and horizontal gradients now accept four values, in the following order: `@start-color`, `@start-percent`, `@end-color`, and `@end-percent`.\n  - Upgrading means specifying all four values in the above order, or specifying variables directly when calling your mixins.\n  - To call a gradient but only set two properties, directly assign values to the variables like so: `#gradient > .vertical(@start-color: red; @end-color: blue);`. Doing so will include the default values for any unmentioned variables.\n- [x] **Drop unused prefixes from several mixins.**\n  - See https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/8380 for more information.\n### Miscellaneous\n- [x] **Go mobile first.** Responsive CSS is no longer separate and all responsive features are now compiled into the core `bootstrap.css` file near. Separate files are no longer required, and have thus been removed.\n- [x] **Upgrade to latest Normalize, and removed reset.less.** \n  - This includes removing reset.less in favor of a dedicated normalize.less file. \n  - Print styles and responsive image CSS (the only meaningful modifications from the previous reset file) have been moved to print.less and scaffolding.less, respectfully.\n- [x] **Moved print styles to separate print.less file.**\n  - Previously print styles were bundled with the scaffolding.less page.\n  - Now within a separate file for easy removal via the Customizer.\n- [x] **Remove layouts.less.** \n  - Since it only held a couple layout styles and the fluid container has been removed (see next section), this file is superfluous. \n  - We've moved the default `.container` styles to `grid.less`.\n- [x] **Add `!important` to `.hide` and `.show`.** \n  - For these classes to work on every element, the specificity either needed to be higher or we needed the `!important` flag. We opted for the latter for fewer lines of code.\n- [x] **Drop `*-important` for `.*-danger`.** \n  - Some elements had red variations that came from different class naming schemes, so we standardized that by switching all red variations to `*-danger`. \n  - Includes buttons, labels, badges, text, alerts. and progress bars.\n- [x] Refactor responsive utility classes to match new media queries.\n## Grid system\n\nThe grid is drastically simpler, yet more powerful, in BS3. We're transitions back to a single grid system, but with all the awesomeness that was present in the old grids. On top of that, we've also added some new features.\n- [x] **Overhaul grid systems to make it fluid and mobile-first.**\n  - Removed the separate fluid grid system, container, and layout as we're down to one grid.\n  - New single grid system (still uses `.row`) utilizes percentages over pixels, `padding` instead of `margin`, and `box-sizing: border-box` for easy math.\n  - The grid is mobile first, meaning it starts out stacked and scales up as necessary to become horizontal via media queries. Previously the grid was built for 940px layouts and scaled up and down.\n  - Nesting is still 100% supported, but columns will be proportionately sized to their parent, just as the old fluid grid behaved.\n  - Offsets are still 100% supported.\n- [x] **Increase specificity of grid classes.**\n  - Instead of `.span*` and `.offset*`, we're now using `.col-*` and `.col-offset-*`, respectively.\n- [x] **Add tiny and small grid systems for phones and tablets.**\n  - Similar to the default grid system, we've added two more sets of grid classes to create more complex layouts for phones and tablets. That means you can optionally utilize 12 columns at two additional important breakpoints.\n  - Use `.col-*` classes for tiny devices (smartphones).\n  - Use `.col-sm-*` classes for small devices (tablets).\n  - The small grid classes also include support for offsets and source ordering, but the tiny grid classes do not.\n- [x] **Simplify required grid variables.**\n  - The `@grid-row-width` and `@grid-column-width` variables have been removed. We didn't use the row width (`@gridRowWidth` as of v2.3.1) variable anywhere in the source and column widths are now derived via simple calculations in our LESS.\n  - We've added a new `@grid-float-breakpoint` variable to customize the point at which the floats and widths kick in for our new mobile-first grid.\n- [x] **New and improved grid mixins.**\n  - Changed `.makeRow()` to `.make-row()`.\n  - Changed `.makeColumn()` to `.make-column()`. In addition, it includes a media query to apply the `float` and `width` when above the `@grid-float-breakpoint` value.\n  - Added `.make-column-offset()` to generate column gaps, similar to the predefined grid classes.\n- [x] **Add `.col-push-*` and `.col-pull-*` modifier classes** for easy column source ordering.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated table grid classes.**\n  - They are no longer necessary given the new grid.\n  - However, we are still removing the float on `.col-*` classes when used within `.table` elements.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated input grid classes.**\n  - Remove input grid mixin and input span classes.\n  - Given new grid system, inputs are always `width: 100%;` to start.\n  - Best practices now are to place 100% wide inputs _within_ grid columns as opposed to using classes directly on input elements.\n- [x] Use `max-width` instead of `width` on all `.container` instances to help prevent some issues with containers in components like navbars.\n## Type\n\nTypography in Bootstrap 3 isn't seeing much change, just a decent amount of cleanup and some small improvements.\n#### Headings\n- [x] Add support for headings classes (e.g., `h1, .h1 { \u2026 }`).\n- [x] Remove `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` from headings to prevent (inconsistent) broken rendering on some Android and Windows devices.\n#### Lists\n- [x] Change `ul.unstyled` to `.list-unstyled`.\n  - No longer dependent on HTML element in the selector.\n  - Can now be used as mixin.\n- [x] Change `ul.inline` to `.list-inline`.\n  - Uses `.list-unstyled` as a mixin to reset default list styles.\n  - Can now be used as a mixin.\n#### Text classes\n- [x] **Changed `.muted` to `.text-muted`** to match the other contextual text colors.\n- [x] Fixed bug with text alignment utility classes and tables.\n#### LESS\n- [x] Remove all `#font` mixins.\n  - We only used these in one place and they honestly just complicated things.\n  - Instead of using mixins, just make use of the `@font-family-` variables.\n- [x] Drop the `@altFontFamily` variable.\n\nWe explored the use of rem units over pixels, but found little benefit to offset the implications of their use. IE8 would still need a pixel fallback, and that's a lot of duplicate lines of code. Moreover, using rems everywhere instead of pixels would exacerbate that problem. Mixing rems and pixels doesn't seem to make sense either right now. However, we can and will continue to evaluate this in future releases.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add support for responsive utility classes on table elements.**\n- [x] Remove `table.info` from table state classes.\n- [x] Added global `text-align: left;` for `<th>` elements (to undo the default center alignment) and removed `font-weight: bold;` from them (bold is a browser default).\n- [x] Improve nesting by scoping all styles to immediate children.\n  - Using the `>` selector, we scope all styles.\n  - Doesn't change much, but does mean you'll need to apply the table classes to all nested tables.\n## Images\n- [x] **Consolidate image thumbnail styles.** No more `.img-polaroid` as it duplicated the same styles as `.thumbnail`. Now you can use `.img-thumbnail` for regular inline(-block) images, or `.thumbnail` for composite components.\n## Buttons\n\nFewer, but better buttons. They're redesigned and we're removing some from the mix because they have no clear and universal semantic purpose.\n- [x] **Default button now requires `.btn-default` class.**\n  - The default gray button requires two classes\u2014`class=\"btn btn-default\"`.\n  - This better matches all our other buttons as well.\n  - We tried to remove the `.btn` class as well, but given the CSS for creating button groups and dropdowns, it's much simpler to keep it around.\n  - While it does add an extra class, it's specificity great simplifies customization methods in plain CSS, and even more so when extending those classes with LESS mixins.\n- [x] **Drop `.btn-inverse`.**\n  - There _really_ is no semantic reasoning for having it, so it's gone.\n- [x] Revamp some of the aesthetics of the buttons (no more outer box-shadow) by default.\n- [x] **Simplify button mixins and pseudo states.**\n  - Removed the `.buttonBackground()` mixin since it was no longer in use.\n  - Added the `.btn-pseudo-states()` mixin for setting button `background-color` and `border-color` for the default and `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and various `disabled` states.\n- [x] **Add justified button group option for link buttons.**\n  - This feature is only available for buttons with link tags, e.g. `<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn\">Button</a>`, and is not compatible with the `<button>` element due to some browser lame-itude that keeps buttons from accepting auto widths on `table-cell` buttons.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add `.active` contextual class.**\n  - Applies the table hover `background-color` to any row or cell that gets the `.active` class.\n- [x] Allow contextual classes to be applied to `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` cells.\n## Forms\n\nForm controls are now 100% width by default, input groups have been overhauled, and form states simplified.\n- [x] **Update box model for inputs.** \n  - Switched to `box-sizing: border-box;` and `width: 100%;` by default for all textual inputs.\n  - This means you'll need to specify a size for inputs, whereas before 3.0 inputs had a set pixel width (around 220px) to start.\n- [x] **Remove `input-prepend` and `input-append` for singular `.input-group`.** The classes have changed for the elements within, and require a bit more markup to use buttons.\n  - Use `.input-group` as the parent class around the input and addon.\n  - For text based prepends/appends, use `.input-group-addon`  instead of `.addon`.\n  - For button prepends/appends, use `.input-group-btn` and place your `.btn` **within** that element.\n- [x] **Drop `.form-search`.**\n- [x] **Add support for `fieldset[disabled]`.** All form controls within a `<fieldset>` with the `disabled` attribute will be styled appropriately.\n- [x] **Drop `cursor: pointer;` from labels** and instead only set them on checkbox and radio label options.\n- [x] **Drop `.controls-row` for grid inputs.** \n  - Given input elements in 3.0 are set to `width: 100%` by default, and since we don't want to implement a separate input grid, we've opted to drop the `.controls-row` functionality.\n  - Instead, folks should wrap inputs in standard grid markup: with a wrapping `.row` and individual `.span*` columns around each input.\n- [x] **Drop `.input-block-level` mixin and class.** \n  - Since inputs are already `width: 100%;`, this is redundant. \n  - **Note:** inputs are still `display: inline-block`, so if you absolutely need them to be block level, you'll need to independently set that yourself.\n- [x] **Drop the `.uneditable-input` control.** Instead, use a read-only input if you must.\n- [x] **Drop `.inline-help` option.**\n- [x] **Horizontal forms are now mobile-first**, meaning at <768px, elements are stacked. Above that, elements are floated and appear side-by-side.\n- [x] **Checkboxes and radios now require an extra `<div>`.** \n  - Instead of `label.checkbox`, you'll need `div.checkbox` with a `<label>` within. \n  - This was done to tighten up the clickable area around labels and avoid potential misclicks.\n- [x] **New classes for inline radios and checkboxes.** \n  - Instead of `.radio.inline`, you now need a single class, `.radio-inline`, for direct use on a `<label>` element. \n  - To be clear, inline radios and checkboxes do not need a wrapping `<div>`, but the default stacked ones do.\n- [x] Added new placeholder syntax to the `.placeholder()` mixin for Firefox 19+.\n- [x] **Drop `.help-inline`.**\n  - Given the 100% wide inputs and focus on mobile, inline help text makes much less sense.\n  - Block help text via `.help-block` remains.\n## Icons\n- [x] **Convert to Glyphicons font and move to separate repository.**\n  - Convert to Glyphicons v1.7 @font-face and drop the old PNGs.\n- [x] **Change required base class and prefix.** \n  - Instead of using an attribute selector, like `[class^=\"glyphicon-\"]`, we now require a base class, `.glyphicon`.\n  - This improves general performance for larger pages while also increasing the durability of our code (as it doesn't enforce a specific order of classes). \n  - This is in addition to the prefix class (which has also been udpated).\n  - All classes start with `.glyphicon-` instead of `.icon-` for a more unique class and consistency with the newly required base class.\n## Responsive utilities\n- [x] Refactor responsive-utilities.less to use new mobile-first approach.\n- [x] Update the docs to reflect the changes in media queries used.\n## Button groups\n- [x] **Add support for dropdowns in button groups (or, nested button groups).**\n- [x] **Update checkbox and radio variations to use form controls.**\n  - Checkbox and radio button groups now use `<input>`s in their markup.\n## Labels and badges\n\nWe have differentiated the labels and badges with v3. The gist is that badges no longer have modifier classes and are purely meant as unread counters.\n- [x] Dropped all modifier variations on badges, making it as neutral as possible, much like those of Mail.app on OS X.\n- [x] Dropped the `.label-inverse` variation (in conjunction with the inverse button being removed).\n- [x] Refactor labels to scale with their parent's `font-size`.\n## Jumbotron (formly hero unit)\n- [x] **Class changed** from `.hero-unit` to `.jumbotron`. Associated variables have also been updated to match.\n- [x] **Lighter `font-weight` for headings**. Uses semibold instead of bold for headings.\n- [x] **Scale `font-size`** in responsive views.\n- [x] Now full-width without rounded corners to in mobile viewports.\n- [x] Improved type styles\u2014now it starts with normal heading sizes and scales to larger sizes given a larger viewport.\n## Breadcrumbs\n- [x] Remove the trailing `/` from the last item.\n## Navigation\n#### Navs\n- [x] **Remove `.nav-list` option**. Replaced by the new `.list-group` component.\n- [x] **Remove tabs on left, right, and bottom.** \n  - Tabs on the left and right, while occasionally useful, have been removed from our CSS.\n  - You can still use the JavaScript plugin and custom CSS to make left/right tabs, but we will no longer include those in the core.\n- [x] **Removed parent `<div>` in the pagination component** and **dropped center and right alignment options**. See #6562 for context.\n#### Navbars\n- [x] **Drop support for `.navbar-search`.** We dropped the `.navbar-search` form layout, so it doesn't make sense to have this anymore. Also, this is just a _slightly_ fancier `.navbar-form`, which we plan on keeping.\n- [x] **Overhaul styles of default navbar** and its sub-components:\n  - Dropdown menu carets (those attached to the actual menu, not the indicators) have been removed so that dropdown menus sit flat against the edge of the navbar.\n  - Navbar vertical dividers have been brought in a smidge, meaning they do not extend the full height of the navbar.\n  - No more box-shadow or gradients on the navbars.\n  - Height of navbar has increased from 44px to 62px for mobile devices, and 50px for desktops.\n- [x] **Removed `.navbar-inner`** and moved relevant styles to `.navbar`. The inner div is no longer required, greatly simplifying our shit.\n- [x] **Changed `.navbar > .nav` to `.navbar-nav`.**\n- [x] **Change `.btn-navbar` to `.navbar-toggle`.**\n  - More consistent naming schema\n  - Redesigned it a bit, lightening the styles and widening it, while also positioning it absolutely to the top right.\n- [x] **Updated navbar brand component:**\n  - Changed `.brand` to `.navbar-brand` for a more consistent naming schema.\n  - Center aligned `.navbar-brand` in mobile views, with a `max-width: 200px;` to limit hit area given a likely navbar toggle will be very near by.\n- [x] **Dropped navbar dividers.**\n- [x] **Added support for disabled nav links.**\n  - Includes new variables like `@navbar-link-color-disabled` and `@navbar-link-bg-disabled`, along with the inverse options.\n#### Dropdowns\n- [x] **Remove submenus** suport in dropdown menus.\n- [x] Removed `.nav-header` and replaced with `.dropdown-header` on account of no more `.nav-list` and that dropdowns still benefit from section headings.\n## Progress bars\n- [x] **Add variables for background colors.** Instead of hard-coded (and different) green, red, yellow, and blue colors, we use the new (more semantic) global colors.\n- [x] **Refactor progress bar classes** for simpler CSS.\n  - New structure is now `.progress` on the outer `<div>` and `.progress-bar` on the inner `<div>`.\n  - Instead of placing modifier classes on the parent, they are placed directly on the bars (e.g., `.progress-bar-info`) in addition to the required `.progress-bar` class.\n## Modals\n- [x] **No longer require use of `.hide`.** We updated the utility classes to use `!important` and to avoid clashing, removed the `.hide` class from modals. Now `display: none;` is set directly in the modals.less file. **When upgrading, be sure to remove the `.hide` class from existing modals.**\n- [x] **Redesign the modals to be mobile-first.**\n  - As BS3 is mobile-first, this new modal also starts at the mobile level and scales up via media queries.\n  - Reintroduces `.modal-open` on the body (so we can nuke the scroll there)\n  - Adds a couple extra levels of markup (namely `.modal-dialog` and `.modal-content`) so we can scroll the entire modal rather than overflow a section within the modal.\n  - Related, `.modal` is now the wrapper, and `.modal-content` is the modal itself. This is so we can still use `position: fixed;`, but make the modal relatively positioned so that scrolling moves the entire modal, not something with it.\n  - Added a `.modal-title` for more consistent and useful targeting of the heading content (previously this was just an `<h3>` and selector performance wise that sucked).\n- [ ] **Test on iOS5.** Not sure if we need to go older, but I want to check here to see how well fixed is supported.\n- [ ] **Test on Android devices** (including native browser and Chrome). I only have a year-old Nexus lying around, so might need help tracking down bugs on older devices.\n- [ ] **Add option to programmatically set width** of the modal.\n- [ ] Prevent `<body>` scrollbar and shifting content with `overflow: hidden;`.\n## Thumbnails\n- [x] **Drop the `.thumbnails` meta component.** Instead of special HTML and CSS for grid sizing, just use the grid system itself. Individual `.thumbnail` styles are still available, but for sizing, require a parent with a set `width` (e.g., grid columns).\n## Alerts\n- [x] `<hr>` elements within any `.alert` component will now be styled to match the border color of the alert.\n- [x] Immediate children links within default alerts, and within paragraph text, are now styled for improved readability. Links are automatically bolded and appear as a slightly darker color than the alert text.\n## New: List groups\n\nAdded a new component, the list group, for creating simple and complex series of components. Perfect for more complex implementations like email inboxes, or simple ones like a list of options.\n- Requires `.list-group` as a parent base class (on a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<div>`)\n- Requires  `.list-group-item` for individual list items\n- List items can also be easily linked\u2014just change from `<ul class=\"list-group\">` and `<li class=\"list-group-item\">` to `<div class=\"list-group\">` and `<a class=\"list-group-item\">`.\n- Option: include a badge, chevron, or both to any list item for automatic placement.\n- Option: use `.list-group-item-heading` and `.list-group-item-text` for custom content implementations.\n\n**Linked list groups replace the nav list component.**\n\nList groups can also be used within panels with the `.list-group-flush` class to take them the full width of the parent panel.\n## New: Panels\n\nAdded a new component, the panel, for easily containing content within a box with an optional heading. Also included are contextual state classes for success, warning, danger, and info.\n## Tooltips\n- [x] Bump font-size from 11px to 12px.\n## Carousel\n- [x] **Redesign!** Lighter styles for the previous and next controls, as well as the carousel captions.\n- [x] **Update required markup for carousel controls.** The `.carousel-control` class now requires another element within it for the previous/next characters. Those characters are now Glyhpicons icons for improved styling and positioning across browsers and devices.\n- [x] **Indicators are now bottom-middle aligned.**\n- [x] **Captions are reinforced as optional** and, by default, are hidden on mobile views, then shown for >768px viewports.\n## Customizer\n- [x] Redesign the entire thing.\n- [ ] Highlight dependencies between components and assets.\n- [ ] Figure out how to load and download the same customizations.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "While our last major version bump (2.0) was a complete rewrite of the docs, CSS, and JavaScript, the move to 3.0 is equally ambitious, but for a different reason: **Bootstrap 3 will be mobile-first.** This is an ongoing document to identify the changes we'll be making along the way.\n## Docs and repo\n\nWe'll be working to simplify the content of the docs once again. Key changes are around the organization of the pages and the tools powering them.\n#### Repository\n- [x] **Add new `dist` folder.**\n  - Includes two subfolders, `css` and `js`, each containing a regular and minified version of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.\n- [x] **Separate dependencies from compiled Bootstrap files** with new `assets` folder.\n  - All files within `assets` are documentation assets or third party dependencies.\n- [x] **Switch from Makefile to Grunt.**\n  - Grunt is JavaScript-based\n  - Helps folks who want to run and compile Bootstrap locally on Windows\n  - Replaces all existing `make` commands with `grunt` commands (all the same functionality, just a different tool)\n#### General docs changes\n- [x] **Convert docs to Jekyll.** \n  - Instead of Mustache, docs templates are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).\n  - This greatly simplifies deploying docs changes, isolates our docs from CSS and JavaScript changes, and drastically decreases the amount of code being tracked in the repo.\n  - It also provides better URLs, page title variables, partials, and code highlighting.\n  - New repo structure\n- [x] **Host previous versions of documentation.**\n  - Instead of having folks download release tags, we'll go back and add the docs for the most recent version (2.3.2) to the site. They'll be available at http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ once v3 goes live.\n- [x] **Move examples to separate repo.**\n  - Fitting with our theme of focus and simplicity in the repo, we're moving all the example templates out into their own repository at [twbs/bootstrap-examples](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-examples).\n  - This keeps the examples as static files without a Jekyll server in the way, so more folks have easy access to them.\n  - It also removes a ton of static files (the example screenshots) from the repo and that's a huge win.\n- [x] **Add \"Customizing Bootstrap\" section** to detail best practices for customizing CSS.\n- [x] **Remove all i18n tags from Mustache templates.** No more `{{_i}}` and `{{/i}}` in the docs templates, just raw HTML in our Mustache files.\n- [x] **Remove Extend page** because it's content was not directly applicable to Bootstrap and out of date with info in the readme and Getting Started page.\n#### Homepage\n- [x] Point link to the new [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com).\n- [x] Remove examples and basically all marketing content from homepage.\n#### Getting started\n- [x] Add Bower installation instructions to guide.\n- [x] Add new Customization best practices section.\n## Global JavaScript\n- [x] Overhaul CSS transitions and reinforce with JavaScript transitions as necessary.\n- [x] Improve noConflict throughout plugins.\n- [x] Namespace events to reduce conflict issues.\n- [x] **Drop bootstrap-typeahead.js.**\n  - For context, see #7805 & https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/88dd9de9bad56b30a12466477a810c78648200c9.\n  - Instead, use [Twitter's typeahead.js plugin](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/).\n## Global CSS\n\nAt a high level, we're dropping IE7 and FF3.6 support, combining standard and responsive CSS into a single file, and consolidating additional code as appropriate.\n### Browser support\n- [x] **Drop support for IE7.** Removed all `*` hacks, such as `*zoom: 1;`, and other IE7-specific lines of CSS.\n- [x] **Drop support for Firefox 3.6.** Removed `-moz-box-shadow` instances and related hacks.\n### LESS changes\n- [x] **Refactor most components to be more mixin-friendly.**\n  - Instead of all component classes being a hodgepodge of un-nested CSS, we'll re-order the code to make it super easy to take any Bootstrap class and use it as a mixin.\n  - Not all components have been rewritten this way, but those that make sense to rename have.\n- [x] **Rename variables to use dashes** instead of camelCase. For example, it's now `@body-bg` instead of `@bodyBackground`.\n- [x] **More consistent variable naming scheme.**\n  - The format of variables was all over the place and has now been standardized.\n  - The general approach is element, state, pseudo state. For example, `@navbar-link-color-hover`.\n- [x] **Replace existing color variables with more semantic ones.**\n  - No more `@blue`, `@orange`, and the like, which we weren't using them much anyway.\n  - They've been replaced with `@brand-primary`, `@brand-success`, and others. These are then assigned on a per-component basis (e.g., `@state-warning-text`, `@btn-background-primary`, etc).\n  - Also removed `@black` and `@white` because `#000` and `#fff` are 20% shorter and not something that should be controlled via variable.\n- [x] **Remove `.border-radius()` and `.border-*-*-radius` mixins.** \n  - As only Android 2.1, iOS 3.2, and older desktop browsers [require a prefixed version](http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius), we've removed the base mixin. Since we no longer require prefixes for independent corners, we've dropped those mixins as well. Mixins for a single side, like `.border-left-radius`, are still available.\n- [x] **Use decimal values in `.opacity()` mixin instead of whole numbers** to match default CSS patterns. \n  - For example, write `.opacity(.5)` instead of `.opacity(50)`.\n- [x] **Add retina image mixin.** Declare a standard and 2x image path and set the size for easy retina images anywhere with `.img-retina()`.\n- [x] **Add new global `@component-active-bg` variable.**\n  - Instead of assigning `@link-color` to multiple variables for backgrounds, we have dedicated a new variable to that.\n  - Change `@component-active-bg` and customize the active states of nav pills, dropdowns, and more.\n- [x] **Update gradient mixins for better color stop support.**\n  - Vertical and horizontal gradients now accept four values, in the following order: `@start-color`, `@start-percent`, `@end-color`, and `@end-percent`.\n  - Upgrading means specifying all four values in the above order, or specifying variables directly when calling your mixins.\n  - To call a gradient but only set two properties, directly assign values to the variables like so: `#gradient > .vertical(@start-color: red; @end-color: blue);`. Doing so will include the default values for any unmentioned variables.\n- [x] **Drop unused prefixes from several mixins.**\n  - See https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/8380 for more information.\n### Miscellaneous\n- [x] **Go mobile first.** Responsive CSS is no longer separate and all responsive features are now compiled into the core `bootstrap.css` file near. Separate files are no longer required, and have thus been removed.\n- [x] **Upgrade to latest Normalize, and removed reset.less.** \n  - This includes removing reset.less in favor of a dedicated normalize.less file. \n  - Print styles and responsive image CSS (the only meaningful modifications from the previous reset file) have been moved to print.less and scaffolding.less, respectfully.\n- [x] **Moved print styles to separate print.less file.**\n  - Previously print styles were bundled with the scaffolding.less page.\n  - Now within a separate file for easy removal via the Customizer.\n- [x] **Remove layouts.less.** \n  - Since it only held a couple layout styles and the fluid container has been removed (see next section), this file is superfluous. \n  - We've moved the default `.container` styles to `grid.less`.\n- [x] **Add `!important` to `.hide` and `.show`.** \n  - For these classes to work on every element, the specificity either needed to be higher or we needed the `!important` flag. We opted for the latter for fewer lines of code.\n- [x] **Drop `*-important` for `.*-danger`.** \n  - Some elements had red variations that came from different class naming schemes, so we standardized that by switching all red variations to `*-danger`. \n  - Includes buttons, labels, badges, text, alerts. and progress bars.\n- [x] Refactor responsive utility classes to match new media queries.\n## Grid system\n\nThe grid is drastically simpler, yet more powerful, in BS3. We're transitions back to a single grid system, but with all the awesomeness that was present in the old grids. On top of that, we've also added some new features.\n- [x] **Overhaul grid systems to make it fluid and mobile-first.**\n  - Removed the separate fluid grid system, container, and layout as we're down to one grid.\n  - New single grid system (still uses `.row`) utilizes percentages over pixels, `padding` instead of `margin`, and `box-sizing: border-box` for easy math.\n  - The grid is mobile first, meaning it starts out stacked and scales up as necessary to become horizontal via media queries. Previously the grid was built for 940px layouts and scaled up and down.\n  - Nesting is still 100% supported, but columns will be proportionately sized to their parent, just as the old fluid grid behaved.\n  - Offsets are still 100% supported.\n- [x] **Increase specificity of grid classes.**\n  - Instead of `.span*` and `.offset*`, we're now using `.col-*` and `.col-offset-*`, respectively.\n- [x] **Add tiny and small grid systems for phones and tablets.**\n  - Similar to the default grid system, we've added two more sets of grid classes to create more complex layouts for phones and tablets. That means you can optionally utilize 12 columns at two additional important breakpoints.\n  - Use `.col-*` classes for tiny devices (smartphones).\n  - Use `.col-sm-*` classes for small devices (tablets).\n  - The small grid classes also include support for offsets and source ordering, but the tiny grid classes do not.\n- [x] **Simplify required grid variables.**\n  - The `@grid-row-width` and `@grid-column-width` variables have been removed. We didn't use the row width (`@gridRowWidth` as of v2.3.1) variable anywhere in the source and column widths are now derived via simple calculations in our LESS.\n  - We've added a new `@grid-float-breakpoint` variable to customize the point at which the floats and widths kick in for our new mobile-first grid.\n- [x] **New and improved grid mixins.**\n  - Changed `.makeRow()` to `.make-row()`.\n  - Changed `.makeColumn()` to `.make-column()`. In addition, it includes a media query to apply the `float` and `width` when above the `@grid-float-breakpoint` value.\n  - Added `.make-column-offset()` to generate column gaps, similar to the predefined grid classes.\n- [x] **Add `.col-push-*` and `.col-pull-*` modifier classes** for easy column source ordering.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated table grid classes.**\n  - They are no longer necessary given the new grid.\n  - However, we are still removing the float on `.col-*` classes when used within `.table` elements.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated input grid classes.**\n  - Remove input grid mixin and input span classes.\n  - Given new grid system, inputs are always `width: 100%;` to start.\n  - Best practices now are to place 100% wide inputs _within_ grid columns as opposed to using classes directly on input elements.\n- [x] Use `max-width` instead of `width` on all `.container` instances to help prevent some issues with containers in components like navbars.\n## Type\n\nTypography in Bootstrap 3 isn't seeing much change, just a decent amount of cleanup and some small improvements.\n#### Headings\n- [x] Add support for headings classes (e.g., `h1, .h1 { \u2026 }`).\n- [x] Remove `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` from headings to prevent (inconsistent) broken rendering on some Android and Windows devices.\n#### Lists\n- [x] Change `ul.unstyled` to `.list-unstyled`.\n  - No longer dependent on HTML element in the selector.\n  - Can now be used as mixin.\n- [x] Change `ul.inline` to `.list-inline`.\n  - Uses `.list-unstyled` as a mixin to reset default list styles.\n  - Can now be used as a mixin.\n#### Text classes\n- [x] **Changed `.muted` to `.text-muted`** to match the other contextual text colors.\n- [x] Fixed bug with text alignment utility classes and tables.\n#### LESS\n- [x] Remove all `#font` mixins.\n  - We only used these in one place and they honestly just complicated things.\n  - Instead of using mixins, just make use of the `@font-family-` variables.\n- [x] Drop the `@altFontFamily` variable.\n\nWe explored the use of rem units over pixels, but found little benefit to offset the implications of their use. IE8 would still need a pixel fallback, and that's a lot of duplicate lines of code. Moreover, using rems everywhere instead of pixels would exacerbate that problem. Mixing rems and pixels doesn't seem to make sense either right now. However, we can and will continue to evaluate this in future releases.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add support for responsive utility classes on table elements.**\n- [x] Remove `table.info` from table state classes.\n- [x] Added global `text-align: left;` for `<th>` elements (to undo the default center alignment) and removed `font-weight: bold;` from them (bold is a browser default).\n- [x] Improve nesting by scoping all styles to immediate children.\n  - Using the `>` selector, we scope all styles.\n  - Doesn't change much, but does mean you'll need to apply the table classes to all nested tables.\n## Images\n- [x] **Consolidate image thumbnail styles.** No more `.img-polaroid` as it duplicated the same styles as `.thumbnail`. Now you can use `.img-thumbnail` for regular inline(-block) images, or `.thumbnail` for composite components.\n## Buttons\n\nFewer, but better buttons. They're redesigned and we're removing some from the mix because they have no clear and universal semantic purpose.\n- [x] **Default button now requires `.btn-default` class.**\n  - The default gray button requires two classes\u2014`class=\"btn btn-default\"`.\n  - This better matches all our other buttons as well.\n  - We tried to remove the `.btn` class as well, but given the CSS for creating button groups and dropdowns, it's much simpler to keep it around.\n  - While it does add an extra class, it's specificity great simplifies customization methods in plain CSS, and even more so when extending those classes with LESS mixins.\n- [x] **Drop `.btn-inverse`.**\n  - There _really_ is no semantic reasoning for having it, so it's gone.\n- [x] Revamp some of the aesthetics of the buttons (no more outer box-shadow) by default.\n- [x] **Simplify button mixins and pseudo states.**\n  - Removed the `.buttonBackground()` mixin since it was no longer in use.\n  - Added the `.btn-pseudo-states()` mixin for setting button `background-color` and `border-color` for the default and `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and various `disabled` states.\n- [x] **Add justified button group option for link buttons.**\n  - This feature is only available for buttons with link tags, e.g. `<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn\">Button</a>`, and is not compatible with the `<button>` element due to some browser lame-itude that keeps buttons from accepting auto widths on `table-cell` buttons.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add `.active` contextual class.**\n  - Applies the table hover `background-color` to any row or cell that gets the `.active` class.\n- [x] Allow contextual classes to be applied to `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` cells.\n## Forms\n\nForm controls are now 100% width by default, input groups have been overhauled, and form states simplified.\n- [x] **Update box model for inputs.** \n  - Switched to `box-sizing: border-box;` and `width: 100%;` by default for all textual inputs.\n  - This means you'll need to specify a size for inputs, whereas before 3.0 inputs had a set pixel width (around 220px) to start.\n- [x] **Remove `input-prepend` and `input-append` for singular `.input-group`.** The classes have changed for the elements within, and require a bit more markup to use buttons.\n  - Use `.input-group` as the parent class around the input and addon.\n  - For text based prepends/appends, use `.input-group-addon`  instead of `.addon`.\n  - For button prepends/appends, use `.input-group-btn` and place your `.btn` **within** that element.\n- [x] **Drop `.form-search`.**\n- [x] **Add support for `fieldset[disabled]`.** All form controls within a `<fieldset>` with the `disabled` attribute will be styled appropriately.\n- [x] **Drop `cursor: pointer;` from labels** and instead only set them on checkbox and radio label options.\n- [x] **Drop `.controls-row` for grid inputs.** \n  - Given input elements in 3.0 are set to `width: 100%` by default, and since we don't want to implement a separate input grid, we've opted to drop the `.controls-row` functionality.\n  - Instead, folks should wrap inputs in standard grid markup: with a wrapping `.row` and individual `.span*` columns around each input.\n- [x] **Drop `.input-block-level` mixin and class.** \n  - Since inputs are already `width: 100%;`, this is redundant. \n  - **Note:** inputs are still `display: inline-block`, so if you absolutely need them to be block level, you'll need to independently set that yourself.\n- [x] **Drop the `.uneditable-input` control.** Instead, use a read-only input if you must.\n- [x] **Drop `.inline-help` option.**\n- [x] **Horizontal forms are now mobile-first**, meaning at <768px, elements are stacked. Above that, elements are floated and appear side-by-side.\n- [x] **Checkboxes and radios now require an extra `<div>`.** \n  - Instead of `label.checkbox`, you'll need `div.checkbox` with a `<label>` within. \n  - This was done to tighten up the clickable area around labels and avoid potential misclicks.\n- [x] **New classes for inline radios and checkboxes.** \n  - Instead of `.radio.inline`, you now need a single class, `.radio-inline`, for direct use on a `<label>` element. \n  - To be clear, inline radios and checkboxes do not need a wrapping `<div>`, but the default stacked ones do.\n- [x] Added new placeholder syntax to the `.placeholder()` mixin for Firefox 19+.\n- [x] **Drop `.help-inline`.**\n  - Given the 100% wide inputs and focus on mobile, inline help text makes much less sense.\n  - Block help text via `.help-block` remains.\n## Icons\n- [x] **Convert to Glyphicons font and move to separate repository.**\n  - Convert to Glyphicons v1.7 @font-face and drop the old PNGs.\n- [x] **Change required base class and prefix.** \n  - Instead of using an attribute selector, like `[class^=\"glyphicon-\"]`, we now require a base class, `.glyphicon`.\n  - This improves general performance for larger pages while also increasing the durability of our code (as it doesn't enforce a specific order of classes). \n  - This is in addition to the prefix class (which has also been udpated).\n  - All classes start with `.glyphicon-` instead of `.icon-` for a more unique class and consistency with the newly required base class.\n## Responsive utilities\n- [x] Refactor responsive-utilities.less to use new mobile-first approach.\n- [x] Update the docs to reflect the changes in media queries used.\n## Button groups\n- [x] **Add support for dropdowns in button groups (or, nested button groups).**\n- [x] **Update checkbox and radio variations to use form controls.**\n  - Checkbox and radio button groups now use `<input>`s in their markup.\n## Labels and badges\n\nWe have differentiated the labels and badges with v3. The gist is that badges no longer have modifier classes and are purely meant as unread counters.\n- [x] Dropped all modifier variations on badges, making it as neutral as possible, much like those of Mail.app on OS X.\n- [x] Dropped the `.label-inverse` variation (in conjunction with the inverse button being removed).\n- [x] Refactor labels to scale with their parent's `font-size`.\n## Jumbotron (formly hero unit)\n- [x] **Class changed** from `.hero-unit` to `.jumbotron`. Associated variables have also been updated to match.\n- [x] **Lighter `font-weight` for headings**. Uses semibold instead of bold for headings.\n- [x] **Scale `font-size`** in responsive views.\n- [x] Now full-width without rounded corners to in mobile viewports.\n- [x] Improved type styles\u2014now it starts with normal heading sizes and scales to larger sizes given a larger viewport.\n## Breadcrumbs\n- [x] Remove the trailing `/` from the last item.\n## Navigation\n#### Navs\n- [x] **Remove `.nav-list` option**. Replaced by the new `.list-group` component.\n- [x] **Remove tabs on left, right, and bottom.** \n  - Tabs on the left and right, while occasionally useful, have been removed from our CSS.\n  - You can still use the JavaScript plugin and custom CSS to make left/right tabs, but we will no longer include those in the core.\n- [x] **Removed parent `<div>` in the pagination component** and **dropped center and right alignment options**. See #6562 for context.\n#### Navbars\n- [x] **Drop support for `.navbar-search`.** We dropped the `.navbar-search` form layout, so it doesn't make sense to have this anymore. Also, this is just a _slightly_ fancier `.navbar-form`, which we plan on keeping.\n- [x] **Overhaul styles of default navbar** and its sub-components:\n  - Dropdown menu carets (those attached to the actual menu, not the indicators) have been removed so that dropdown menus sit flat against the edge of the navbar.\n  - Navbar vertical dividers have been brought in a smidge, meaning they do not extend the full height of the navbar.\n  - No more box-shadow or gradients on the navbars.\n  - Height of navbar has increased from 44px to 62px for mobile devices, and 50px for desktops.\n- [x] **Removed `.navbar-inner`** and moved relevant styles to `.navbar`. The inner div is no longer required, greatly simplifying our shit.\n- [x] **Changed `.navbar > .nav` to `.navbar-nav`.**\n- [x] **Change `.btn-navbar` to `.navbar-toggle`.**\n  - More consistent naming schema\n  - Redesigned it a bit, lightening the styles and widening it, while also positioning it absolutely to the top right.\n- [x] **Updated navbar brand component:**\n  - Changed `.brand` to `.navbar-brand` for a more consistent naming schema.\n  - Center aligned `.navbar-brand` in mobile views, with a `max-width: 200px;` to limit hit area given a likely navbar toggle will be very near by.\n- [x] **Dropped navbar dividers.**\n- [x] **Added support for disabled nav links.**\n  - Includes new variables like `@navbar-link-color-disabled` and `@navbar-link-bg-disabled`, along with the inverse options.\n#### Dropdowns\n- [x] **Remove submenus** suport in dropdown menus.\n- [x] Removed `.nav-header` and replaced with `.dropdown-header` on account of no more `.nav-list` and that dropdowns still benefit from section headings.\n## Progress bars\n- [x] **Add variables for background colors.** Instead of hard-coded (and different) green, red, yellow, and blue colors, we use the new (more semantic) global colors.\n- [x] **Refactor progress bar classes** for simpler CSS.\n  - New structure is now `.progress` on the outer `<div>` and `.progress-bar` on the inner `<div>`.\n  - Instead of placing modifier classes on the parent, they are placed directly on the bars (e.g., `.progress-bar-info`) in addition to the required `.progress-bar` class.\n## Modals\n- [x] **No longer require use of `.hide`.** We updated the utility classes to use `!important` and to avoid clashing, removed the `.hide` class from modals. Now `display: none;` is set directly in the modals.less file. **When upgrading, be sure to remove the `.hide` class from existing modals.**\n- [x] **Redesign the modals to be mobile-first.**\n  - As BS3 is mobile-first, this new modal also starts at the mobile level and scales up via media queries.\n  - Reintroduces `.modal-open` on the body (so we can nuke the scroll there)\n  - Adds a couple extra levels of markup (namely `.modal-dialog` and `.modal-content`) so we can scroll the entire modal rather than overflow a section within the modal.\n  - Related, `.modal` is now the wrapper, and `.modal-content` is the modal itself. This is so we can still use `position: fixed;`, but make the modal relatively positioned so that scrolling moves the entire modal, not something with it.\n  - Added a `.modal-title` for more consistent and useful targeting of the heading content (previously this was just an `<h3>` and selector performance wise that sucked).\n- [ ] **Test on iOS5.** Not sure if we need to go older, but I want to check here to see how well fixed is supported.\n- [ ] **Test on Android devices** (including native browser and Chrome). I only have a year-old Nexus lying around, so might need help tracking down bugs on older devices.\n- [ ] **Add option to programmatically set width** of the modal.\n- [ ] Prevent `<body>` scrollbar and shifting content with `overflow: hidden;`.\n## Thumbnails\n- [x] **Drop the `.thumbnails` meta component.** Instead of special HTML and CSS for grid sizing, just use the grid system itself. Individual `.thumbnail` styles are still available, but for sizing, require a parent with a set `width` (e.g., grid columns).\n## Alerts\n- [x] `<hr>` elements within any `.alert` component will now be styled to match the border color of the alert.\n- [x] Immediate children links within default alerts, and within paragraph text, are now styled for improved readability. Links are automatically bolded and appear as a slightly darker color than the alert text.\n## New: List groups\n\nAdded a new component, the list group, for creating simple and complex series of components. Perfect for more complex implementations like email inboxes, or simple ones like a list of options.\n- Requires `.list-group` as a parent base class (on a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<div>`)\n- Requires  `.list-group-item` for individual list items\n- List items can also be easily linked\u2014just change from `<ul class=\"list-group\">` and `<li class=\"list-group-item\">` to `<div class=\"list-group\">` and `<a class=\"list-group-item\">`.\n- Option: include a badge, chevron, or both to any list item for automatic placement.\n- Option: use `.list-group-item-heading` and `.list-group-item-text` for custom content implementations.\n\n**Linked list groups replace the nav list component.**\n\nList groups can also be used within panels with the `.list-group-flush` class to take them the full width of the parent panel.\n## New: Panels\n\nAdded a new component, the panel, for easily containing content within a box with an optional heading. Also included are contextual state classes for success, warning, danger, and info.\n## Tooltips\n- [x] Bump font-size from 11px to 12px.\n## Carousel\n- [x] **Redesign!** Lighter styles for the previous and next controls, as well as the carousel captions.\n- [x] **Update required markup for carousel controls.** The `.carousel-control` class now requires another element within it for the previous/next characters. Those characters are now Glyhpicons icons for improved styling and positioning across browsers and devices.\n- [x] **Indicators are now bottom-middle aligned.**\n- [x] **Captions are reinforced as optional** and, by default, are hidden on mobile views, then shown for >768px viewports.\n## Customizer\n- [x] Redesign the entire thing.\n- [ ] Highlight dependencies between components and assets.\n- [ ] Figure out how to load and download the same customizations.\n",

More personally, I find the current dev process incredibly fatiguing\u2014as a maintainer, it's hard to be motivated to jump into this codebase right now.\n\nMy goal here is to overhaul the build process and make Bootstrap development more approachable to everyone (myself included). Originally I was thinking Gulp would be our answer, but it's still a task runner build on npm rather than npm itself.\n\nSo far I've started to pull apart a few bits of our current tooling and replacing them with npm scripts. Right now they all live under `tasks/` and are split by `dist/` and `docs/`. I'm probably doing a ton wrong, but maybe you can help with that :D.\n\nHere's the list of tasks we need for developing and distributing Bootstrap:\n- [ ] **CSS**\n  - [x] Lint Sass before trying to compile (with `stylelint` over `scss-lint`)\n  - [x] Compile Sass files with node-sass (no more Ruby options)\n  - [x] Compile and minify Sass files\n  - [x] Autoprefixer compiled CSS files\n- [ ] **JavaScript**\n  - [ ] Babel\n  - [ ] Uglify\n  - [ ] Qunit tests\n  - [ ] Concatenate and minify\n- [ ] **Docs/development**\n  - [ ] Update version\n  - [ ] Shrinkwrap dependencies\n  - [ ] Lint HTML files\n  - [ ] Run Jekyll and watch Sass/JS files (stylelint, compile, autoprefixer)\n  - [ ] Saucelabs?\n  - [ ] Package dist files in zipfile for release\n  - [ ] Deploy Jekyll `_site` directory to remote to update docs site\n\nI'm probably missing some tasks/scripts we need, but I do believe we need the above. These tasks should be runnable by us as maintainers, as well as casual users who wish to extend Bootstrap's code and docs, so I want them to be clear, concise, and documented.\n\n/cc @twbs/team \n",

I'm especially not sure if we should always zero the manifest on collectstatic, or if we should only zero the manifest when --clear is called.  \n\n```\n#current version\ndef on_collectstatic(self, command):\n    self.hashed_files = OrderedDict()\n```\n\nVs.\n\n```\n#reasonable alternate version\ndef on_collectstatic(self, command):\n    if command.clear:\n        self.hashed_files = OrderedDict()\n```\n\nI could go either way on the question.\n\nCopied from ticket:\nThere is some surprising behavior when the new HashedFilesMixin is used with the new ManifestFilesMixin.\nWhen you run manage.py collectstatic --clear:\n1) a copy of the old manifest.json is loaded from disk into memory at ManifestFilesMixin.hashed_files. This happens at the very beginning of collectstatic (when ManifestFilesMixin.**init** is called, which happens when the storage is initialized, which happens during Command.**init**) \n2) the old manifest.json is deleted (which would lead most people to believe the old manifest information is deleted as well)\n3) new files are added to the ManifestFilesMixin.hashed_files dict, and updated files get their records updated. But, this is building on top of the last version of manifest.json. Keys for deleted files are never removed and the deleted file mappings persist in the new manifest.json which gets written back to disk at the end of collectstatic's post_process phase.\n\n[Rest of ticket omitted]\n\nTo make testing cleaner, I broke post_process into two steps:  post_process and save_manifest.  Long term I think this is also a better API that will allow people to write cleaner sub-classes.  I found this bug writing sub-classes of ManifestFilesMixin and the code to save the manifest is pretty ugly with the current API of post_process doing both steps. \n",

Now, if you have `Tab1` as selected then select `Tab2` and simply refresh the page. We have disabled the broweser storage, it means `Tab3` should be selected. But it's not. \n#### Reason:\n\nhttps://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/staging/media/system/js/tabs.js#L45 this line of code is expecting `boolean` but when you will check in cosole with code,\n\n``` javascript\nconsole.log(typeof this.options.useStorage);\n```\n\nit will show `string` and because of that condition in above file always become `true`.\n#### Test & Confirm fix\n\nApply this patch and confirm with enabling or disabling browser storage.\n",

Create tabs using something like this `echo JHtml::_('tabs.start', 'signInPane', array('startOffset' => 2, 'useCookie' => false));` and anything else that's necessary to create the rest of the tabs pane.\n2.

This fix addresses issue #37022 \r\n\r\nThe following steps are made to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. kubectl create -f guestbook.yaml\r\nA deployment is created with a volume spec - \"hello-master\" and volumePath - \"[datastore1] kubevols/sample-volume\". At this point, the pod has the volume \"[datastore1]kubevols/sample-volume\" mounted on it.\r\n\r\n2. kubectl delete -f guestbook.yaml\r\nWhen the deployment is deleted, kubernetes attempts to unmount the volume with volumeName - hello-master. Since it cannot find the volume \"hello-master\" mounted on the node, it stalls and doesn't make any progress after it.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, any subsequent recreation of deployments fails to mount the volume on the node as  the node stalls.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurred after fixing for issue #33203 on kubernetes repo -  Fix volume states out of sync problem after kubelet restarts. There were changes to SYNC loop logic in this fix.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 fixes that needs to made on 1.4.5 branch\r\n1. The changes to constructVolumeSpec() in the vSphere plugin to get the volumePath instead of volumeName.\r\n2.

We may also want to use these labels as list filters in the future. The `containerMeta` should be seldom or even never changed.\n  - containerInfo: the `containerInfo` will be saved in one label as a whole.\n- **Checkpoint last container status into container info label.** With this, we can remove historical containers as soon as the new container is created (see #25239). However, because kubelet may still work with old containers which don't have this label, we still can't rely on this for now. Currently, we only use the `lastStatus` to calculate the restart count. @yujuhong @dchen1107 Can we assume that people will always drain node before updating kubelet? If so we can start relying on labels.\n- **Add label version.** Whenever we make any incompatible changes to the labels, we should bump up the label version and try to support backward compatibility relying on label version.\n\nNotice that with this PR, kubelet will stop reading _restart count_ and _termination message path_ from labels added in v1.2. It means that if someone does kubelet live upgrade from v1.2 to v1.3, the termination message of old containers will be lost, and restart count of the new container will be recalculated from 0.\n\nWe could add some code to prevent this, but that will make the code a bit more complex. Because restart count is just best effort and termination message path is seldom used, can we just ignore that like what we have done in v1.2?

And issues related to forced ownership.\r\n\r\n- Improvements to the UnarchiveError Exception, so it can report more detailed information to why an archive cannot be handled.\r\n\r\n- A bugfix relatd to unicode filenames and crc32 handling.\r\n\r\n- Renamed a few things so the code is easier to read.\r\n\r\n- Ensure gtar considers size changes to unarchive its content. This fixes ansible/ansible-modules-core#5149\r\n\r\n- Added a note about ZIP archives without directories. This fixes ansible/ansible-modules-core#5744.\r\n\r\nThe unarchive module is a hard beast to tame, corner-cases and platform-specific issues make it hard to troubleshoot individual issues.\r\n\r\n- Improves the default output (e.g. unzip no longer shows standard output, just like gtar) and adds the ability to get debug-output when using -vvvv (verbosity >= 4) or -vvvvv. So that when issues are i reported we have the means to look what is going on internally.\r\n\r\n- Because the output by default is reduced, proper warnings/errors are now more obvious to end-users, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTASK [unarchive]\r\n***************************************************************\r\ntask path: /home/dag/home-made/ansible.testing/test126.yml:11\r\nchanged: [localhost] => {\"changed\": true, \"dest\": \"/tmp/test126a\", \"extract_results\": {\"cmd\":\r\n[\"/usr/bin/unzip\", \"-q\", \"-o\", \"/home/dag/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1479989967.66-3171393713112/source\",\r\n\"-x\", \"some.directory/\", \"another.directory/simple.test.file.txt\", \"-d\", \"/tmp/test126a\"], \"err\":\r\n\"caution: excluded filename not matched: some.directory/\\ncaution: excluded filename not matched:\r\nanother.directory/simple.test.file.txt\\n\", \"out\": \"\", \"rc\": 0}, \"gid\": 500, \"group\": \"dag\", \"handler\":\r\n\"ZipArchive\", \"mode\": \"0775\", \"owner\": \"dag\", \"secontext\": \"unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0\",\r\n\"size\": 4096, \"src\": \"/home/dag/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1479989967.66-3171393713112/source\",\r\n\"state\": \"directory\", \"uid\": 500}\r\n```\r\nWhereas before the complete list of deflated files was being shown (when using -v) which was much more than anyone was willing to look at.\r\n\r\n*Migrated from https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/5721*",

      "pr2.desc": "~~This is still a work in progress, but I'd like to get some feedback on the architecture and design here before applying this same sort of scheme to `setindex!`.~~\n\nThe basic idea is that the only getindex method defined in base for abstract arrays is `getindex(::AbstractArray, I...)`. And the only methods that an AbstractArray subtype must define are `size` and just one `getindex` method:\n\n``` julia\ngetindex(::T, ::Int) # if linearindexing(T) == LinearFast()\ngetindex(::T, ::Int, ::Int, #=...ndims(A) indices...=#) if LinearSlow()\n```\n\nUnfortunately, it is currently impossible to express the latter method for arbitrary dimensionalities, but in practice it's not a big issue: most LinearSlow() arrays have a fixed dimension.\n\nThis is achieved through dispatch on an internal `_getindex` method, which recomputes the indices such that it can call the canonical `getindex` method that the user must define.  If the user has not defined their canonical method, it will fall back to an error method in `_getindex`.  I use similar scheme for `unsafe_getindex`, with the exception that we can fallback to the safe version if the subtype hasn't defined the canonical unsafe method.  This enables fast vector indexing by checking bounds of the index vectors instead of on each element.  And once `@inbounds` is extensible, AbstractArrays will be able to support it by default.\n\nThe difficulty with all this redirection is that an extra function call can wreck indexing performance, and it can be hard to avoid.  ~~I've had particular difficulty getting good performance with `CartesianIndexes`, and I still lag in performance there by 20x for big arrays.  I think call site inline annotations would be a magic bullet, but there may be other tricks we can use, too.  I've not looked into this very carefully yet, though.~~ (Fixed with a more sensible inlining strategy)\n\nTL/DR:\n\nIn my cursory performance tests [hacked onto Tim's indexing perf suite from his reshape work](https://gist.github.com/mbauman/39bb490ce2bee52417f1) (more tests are needed), I'm close to matching _or outperforming_ master with `Array` with only these definitions:\n\n``` julia\njulia> methods(getindex, (Array, Any...))\n3-element Array{Any,1}:\n getindex(A::Array{T,N},i::Int) at array.jl:304\n getindex{T<:Real}(A::Array{T,N},I::Range{T<:Real}) at array.jl:347 # Needed for bootstrap\n getindex(A::AbstractArray{T,N},I...) at abstractarray.jl:492\n```\n\n(Of course, in places where we're not quite able to close the gap we can always reinstate the specialized methods. This is just a very useful stress-test of both functionality and performance.)\n\ncc: @timholy \n",

      "pr1.desc": "This is a backwards incompatible change for people using `store/serialization`.\n\nThis PR fixes the issue raised at https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/13861\n\nThe main issue is that [encode_with](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L277) says that the attributes value that is set to the `coder` object is the same that gets set at [init_with](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L205) and while this is true, `init_with` calls `self.class.initialize_attributes(coder['attributes'])` without setting the `:serialized` option and creates the `Serialization::Attibute` object with the `serialized` field set to true as can be seen [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/serialization.rb#L105), but the YAML produced by a `YAML.dump` call is like this:\n\n``` yaml\n--- !ruby/object:Admin::User\nattributes:\n  id: 721854607\n  name: John Doe\n  settings: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess\n    color: black\n  preferences: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess\n    remember_login: true\n  json_data: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess\n    height: tall\n  json_data_empty: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess\n    is_a_good_guy: true\n  params: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess {}\n  account_id: \n```\n\nThe `json_data` field that should have been a JSON string, since it's store `:coder` turns it into JSON before saving it, was saved just like any YAML field. Now, when you `YAML.load` the content above you will get the following error:\n\n```\nTypeError: no implicit conversion of ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess into String\n```\n\nAnd it happens because the `init_with` method expected to receive a JSON string at the `json_data` field and not the `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess`, since `:serialized` will be set to true. That's why at the original issue description @hundredwatt says that calling `record.reload` works, because when you call `reload` at the object `init_with` is called with the data as it comes from the database column, that will be a JSON string and not a real hash object.\n\nThe solution here was creating a separate `attributes_for_coder` method that the serialization code can override when needed to generate the encoded value for the field so it can be safely dumped and then loaded back again through the correct process.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "ActionView has a fallback feature to render an `:html` format template as a \"template of last resort\" even when `:js` is the only format specified, to support rendering HTML-formatted responses to XHR requests.\n\nI believe this fallback is broken when using multiple view paths. LookupContext treats a requested `:js` format as `[:js, :html]` when rendering anything except a layout. So the first view path will be matched against formats of `[:js, :html]` before the second view path is considered. Thus an \"index.html.erb\" in the first path will prevent an \"index.js.erb\" in any subsequent view paths from being rendered, even though the only format requested was JS.\n\nMy fix pushes down the fallback to lookup time; it attempts to look up the JS template in the PathSet, rescues any MissingTemplate, and retries with :html. I was conflicted about using exceptions for flow control here, but I wanted to do as little violence to the PathSet API as possible, and it currently raises MissingTemplate on missing templates.\n\nSome care had to be taken to ensure that layouts still only render their first format (so, for example, a JS request never renders an HTML template). That motivated the introduction of the `@layout_format` ivar.\n\nMajor props to the Rails team, especially @josevalim, for how accessible this code is.

It also contains httpbin, and nginx so we get a full http/https/sni/httpbin/badssl type of testing capabilities.\n\nThe names such as `ansible.http.tests` is made available through docker linking, and reference the container running nginx/httpbin.\n\nIf desired we can pull the docker image in from https://github.com/sivel/docker-images/tree/master/httptester and make it available from `ansible/ansible:httptester` or similar.\n\nIt will probably take a while for the builds to complete.

This should reduce the total number of references created and also reduce the number of `value()` computation as the same reference can be reused across multiple curlies.\n\nThis also allows Glimmer to better optimize things \u2013 for example, if the component is invoked with literals (`{{foo-bar foo=true}}`) and `foo` is then used in a conditional in its layout (`{{#if foo}}...`), Glimmer will be now able to see that `foo` is a const reference and optimize out the updating step.

      "pr1.desc": "The code for the current multi-language system is unnecessarily complex. This PR tries to improve on #5135 and simplify the code further.\n### Goal\n\nThis PR tries to achieve 4 goals:\n1. Remove a few inconsistencies in the code that may have resulted in hard-to-find bugs.\n2. Improve performance by moving the language-URL-behavior from several different *HelperRoute classes into the single plugin.\n3. Allow the routing code to work with the language data where necessary in order to simplify the code there, too.\n4. Allow for correct URLs and moving between languages where this is expected.\n\nEspecially the last part should be discussed in this PR. The new code does not force you to always use one specific language, but allows you to switch between them. The behavior should be the following:\n- If a user accesses a site for the first time, the plugin looks up if it should simply direct to the default language or try to discover the right language via the browser.\n- The language of the page is always determined by the URL.\n- On each pageload, a cookie is set with the current language. If a page has no attached language information, the data from the cookie is taken, otherwise the URL overrides that cookie.\n\nThis means that a user that surfs a french website and then clicks on a link to a specific english page on the site, the user is not redirected to a french page with the english content inside or an error page or similar.\n### How to test\n\nSimply apply the changes included in here and see that the URLs stay the same and the behavior for language handling is the way you expect it.\n### Routing changes\n\nThe above mentioned routing changes are primarily aimed at easing the code in other parts of Joomla. Currently, a URL is first created via a *HelperRoute class, which replaces the ISO language code from the content item with the corresponding SEF code. The language plugin, which right now is run before every other code in the routing process, takes that SEF code, compares it to the existing SEF codes, looks up the right language for it and then takes the SEF code from that language and adds it as part of the path in the URL. After that, it deletes the language code from the query, so that it is not available to the rest of the routing process anymore. Since the language is an important part of looking up the right Itemid, this means that the lookup of that part has to stay in the *HelperRoute class, instead of moving it to the component router itself.\n### Notice\n\nI changed the above description massively on January 3rd, 2015 in order to make it better understandable.

This introduced some overhead in doing certain operations, which I spent a lot of time optimizing away, further optimizations will come from cythonizing the core/internals, which should be straightforward at this point_\n\nHighlites below:\n\nIn 0.13.0 there is a major refactor primarily to subclass `Series` from `NDFrame`,\nwhich is the base class currently for `DataFrame` and `Panel`, to unify methods\nand behaviors. Series formerly subclassed directly from `ndarray`.\n- Refactor of series.py/frame.py/panel.py to move common code to generic.py\n  - added `_setup_axes` to created generic NDFrame structures\n  - moved methods\n    - `from_axes,_wrap_array,axes,ix,shape,empty,swapaxes,transpose,pop`\n    - `__iter__,keys,__contains__,__len__,__neg__,__invert__`\n    - `convert_objects,as_blocks,as_matrix,values`\n    - `__getstate__,__setstate__` (though compat remains in frame/panel)\n    - `__getattr__,__setattr__`\n    - `_indexed_same,reindex_like,align,where,mask,replace`\n    - `filter` (also added axis argument to selectively filter on a different axis)\n    - `reindex,reindex_axis` (which was the biggest change to make generic)\n    - `truncate` (moved to become part of `NDFrame`)\n- These are API changes which make `Panel` more consistent with `DataFrame`\n  - swapaxes on a Panel with the same axes specified now return a copy\n  - support attribute access for setting\n  - filter supports same api as original `DataFrame` filter\n- Reindex called with no arguments will now return a copy of the input object\n- Series now inherits from `NDFrame` rather than directly from `ndarray`.\n  There are several minor changes that affect the API.\n  - numpy functions that do not support the array interface will now\n    return `ndarrays` rather than series, e.g. `np.diff` and `np.where`\n  - `Series(0.5)` would previously return the scalar `0.5`, this is no\n    longer supported\n  - several methods from frame/series have moved to `NDFrame`\n    (convert_objects,where,mask)\n  - `TimeSeries` is now an alias for `Series`. the property `is_time_series`\n    can be used to distinguish (if desired)\n- Refactor of Sparse objects to use BlockManager\n  - Created a new block type in internals, `SparseBlock`, which can hold multi-dtypes\n    and is non-consolidatable. `SparseSeries` and `SparseDataFrame` now inherit\n    more methods from there hierarchy (Series/DataFrame), and no longer inherit\n    from `SparseArray` (which instead is the object of the `SparseBlock`)\n  - Sparse suite now supports integration with non-sparse data. Non-float sparse\n    data is supportable (partially implemented)\n  - Operations on sparse structures within DataFrames should preserve sparseness,\n    merging type operations will convert to dense (and back to sparse), so might\n    be somewhat inefficient\n  - enable setitem on `SparseSeries` for boolean/integer/slices\n  - `SparsePanels` implementation is unchanged (e.g. not using BlockManager, needs work)\n- added `ftypes` method to Series/DataFame, similar to `dtypes`, but indicates\n  if the underlying is sparse/dense (as well as the dtype)\n- All `NDFrame` objects now have a `_prop_attributes`, which can be used to indcated various\n  values to propogate to a new object from an existing (e.g. name in `Series` will follow\n  more automatically now)\n\nPerf changed a bit primarily in groupby where a Series has to be reconstructed in order to be passed to the function (in some cases). I basically pass a Series-like class to the grouped function to see if it doesn't raise, if its ok, then it is used rather than a full Series in order to reduce overhead of the Series creation for each group.\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngroupby_multi_python                         | 109.3636 |  78.3370 |   1.3961 |\nframe_iteritems                              |   3.4664 |   2.0154 |   1.7200 |\nframe_fancy_lookup                           |   3.3991 |   1.6137 |   2.1064 |\nsparse_frame_constructor                     |  11.7100 |   5.3363 |   2.1944 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTarget [c5d9495] : BUG: fix ujson handling of new series object\nBase   [1b91f4f] : BUG: Fixed non-unique indexing memory allocation issue with .ix/.loc (GH4280)\n```\n",

      "pr2.desc": "Support for numeric dtype propogation and coexistance in DataFrames. Prior to 0.10.2, numeric dtypes passed to DataFrames were always casted to `int64` or `float64`. Now, if a dtype is passed (either directly via the `dtype` keyword, a passed `ndarray`, or a passed `Series`, then it will be preserved in DataFrame operations. Furthermore, different numeric dtypes will **NOT** be combined. The following example will give you a taste. This closes GH #622\n\nother changes introduced in this PR (i removed all datetime like issues to PR # 2752 - should be merged first)\n\nENH:\n- validated get_numeric_data returns correct dtypes\n- added `blocks` attribute (and as_blocks()) method that returns a \n  dict of dtype -> homogeneous dtyped DataFrame, analagous to `values` attribute\n- added keyword 'raise_on_error' to astype, which can be set to false to exluded non-numeric columns\n- changed `get_dtype_counts()` to use `blocks` attribute\n- changed `convert_objects()` to use the internals method convert (which is block operated)\n  - added option to `convert_numeric=False` to `convert_objects` to force numeric conversion (or set to `np.nan`, turned off by default)\n  - added option to `convert_dates='coerce'` to `convert_objects` to force datetimelike conversions (or set to `NaT`) for invalid values, turned off by default, returns datetime64[ns] dtype\n- groupby operations to respect dtype inputs wherever possible, even if intermediate casting is required (obviously if the input are ints and nans are resulting, this is casted),\n  all cython functions are implemented\n- auto generation of most groupby functions by type is now in `generated_code.py`\n  e.g. (group_add,group_mean)\n- added full `float32/int16/int8` support for all numeric operations, including (`diff, backfill, pad, take`)\n- added `dtype` display to show on Series as a default\n\nBUG:\n- fixed up tests from from_records to use record arrays directly\n  NOTE: using tuples will remove dtype info from the input stream (using a record array is ok though!)\n- fixed merging to correctly merge on multiple dtypes with blocks (e.g. float64 and float32 in other merger)\n- (#2623 can be fixed, but is dependent on #2752)\n- fixed #2778, bug in pad/backfill with 0-len frame\n- fixed very obscure bug in DataFrame.from_records with dictionary and columns passed and hash randomization is on!\n- integer upcasts will now happend on `where` when using inplace ops (#2793)\n\nTST:\n- tests added for merging changes, astype, convert\n- fixes for test_excel on 32-bit\n- fixed test_resample_median_bug_1688\n- separated out test_from_records_dictlike\n- added tests for (GH #797)\n- added lots of tests for`where`\n\nDOC:\n- added DataTypes section in Data Structres intro\n- whatsnew examples\n\n_It would be really helpful if some users could give this a test run before merging.

This is already how it\n   works before this commit.\n   \n   Same goes for templates \u2013 if the user defined a set of templates\n   (usually in the file system), that set is now considered exhaustive,\n   which means that \u201cmissing\u201d templates are considered `UnknownFormat`\n   errors (406).\n3. To keep API endpoints simple, the implicit render behavior for\n   actions with no templates defined at all (regardless of formats,\n   locales, variants, etc) are defaulted to \u201c204 No Content\u201d. This\n   is a strictly narrower version of the feature landed in #19036 and\n   #19377.\n4. To avoid confusion when interacting in the browser, these actions\n   will raise a `TemplateMissing` error for \u201cinteractive\u201d requests\n   instead. (The precise definition of \u201cinteractive\u201d requests might\n   change \u2013 the spirit here is to give helpful messages and avoid\n   confusions.)\n\nCloses #20666, #23062, #23077, #23564\n\n[Godfrey Chan, Jon Moss, Mike Clark, Matthew Draper, Kasper Timm Hansen]\n\n---\n\nTODO:\n- [x] Finish porting the new tests in the other PRs\n- [x] Write helpful error messages for the two \"no templates\" scenario\n",

      "pr2.desc": "I ran into an issue with my ActionCable enabled app where the server was locking up constantly using the current master branch from the rails repository. I was able to recreate the issue in my own fork of the ActionCable examples repo.\n\nI modified the ActionCable example to mount ActionCable at the '/ws' endpoint in the routes.rb file and I also created a second channel which the client subscribes to at the same time as the first: https://github.com/rails/actioncable-examples/compare/master...eacaps:2channel-rails5-master.\n\nTo take it one step further, I created a test case in the actioncable examples to demonstrate the issue. The issue wasn't always manifesting itself, so I monkeypatched the ActionCable::Server::Base channel_classes method to put a small delay in: https://github.com/eacaps/actioncable-examples/commit/300de61fae59121ec7fb58b4df6bc00d9b8ef08b.\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\nOpen a terminal\n$ git clone https://github.com/eacaps/actioncable-examples.git\n$ cd actioncable-examples\n$ git checkout deadlock-test-case-failure\n$ ./bin/setup\n$ rake\nRun options: --seed 54861\n\n# Running:\n\n=> Booting Puma\n=> Rails 5.0.0.beta3 application starting in test on http://0.0.0.0:3000\n=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options\nDEPRECATION WARNING: `config.serve_static_files` is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1.\nPlease use `config.public_file_server.enabled = true` instead.\n (called from block in <top (required)> at /Users/eacaps/workspace/rails5/deadlock/config/environments/test.rb:16)\nDEPRECATION WARNING: `config.static_cache_control` is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1.\nPlease use\n`config.public_file_server.headers = { 'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=3600' }`\ninstead.\n (called from block in <top (required)> at /Users/eacaps/workspace/rails5/deadlock/config/environments/test.rb:17)\nPuma starting in single mode...\n* Version 3.4.0 (ruby 2.2.2-p95), codename: Owl Bowl Brawl\n* Min threads: 0, max threads: 16\n* Environment: development\n* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000\nUse Ctrl-C to stop\nstarting deadlock test\nStarted GET \"/ws\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-04-26 15:09:57 -0400\nStarted GET \"/ws/\" [WebSocket] for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-04-26 15:09:57 -0400\nSuccessfully upgraded to WebSocket (REQUEST_METHOD: GET, HTTP_CONNECTION: Upgrade, HTTP_UPGRADE: websocket)\n  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  \"users\".* FROM \"users\" WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = ?

After digging into the issue it seems like it has something to do with active_support and dependencies.rb which are used by the require statement in the ActionCable::Server::Base channel_classes method. I'm not an expert in rails, but it seemed that both threads were trying to grab the Dependencies.load_interlock and having issues resolving that situation. The simplest solution I could think up was to load the channel classes when the server is initialized. I decided to put it in the ActionCable::Server::Base call method because that seems like the most reasonable place for it. I created a separate branch called `deadlock-test-case` that uses my proposed fixed rails5 branch `actioncable/server-base-channel-classes`.\n\n```\n$ git checkout deadlock-test-case\n$ bundle install\n$ rake\nRun options: --seed 58815\n\n# Running:\n\n=> Booting Puma\n=> Rails 5.0.0.beta3 application starting in test on http://0.0.0.0:3000\n=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options\nDEPRECATION WARNING: `serve_static_files` is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1.\nPlease use `config.public_file_server.enabled = true` instead.\n (called from block in <top (required)> at /Users/eacaps/workspace/rails5/deadlock/config/environments/test.rb:16)\nDEPRECATION WARNING: `static_cache_control` is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1.\nPlease use\n`config.public_file_server.headers = { 'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=3600' }`\ninstead.\n (called from block in <top (required)> at /Users/eacaps/workspace/rails5/deadlock/config/environments/test.rb:17)\n70180801995260 - entering channel_classes\n70180801995260 - channel_classes at each\n70180801995260 - channel_classes past each\n70180801995260 - channel_classes return each_with_object\nPuma starting in single mode...\n* Version 3.4.0 (ruby 2.2.2-p95), codename: Owl Bowl Brawl\n* Min threads: 0, max threads: 16\n* Environment: development\n* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000\nUse Ctrl-C to stop\nstarting deadlock test\nStarted GET \"/ws\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-04-26 15:21:51 -0400\nStarted GET \"/ws/\" [WebSocket] for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-04-26 15:21:51 -0400\nSuccessfully upgraded to WebSocket (REQUEST_METHOD: GET, HTTP_CONNECTION: Upgrade, HTTP_UPGRADE: websocket)\n  User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  \"users\".* FROM \"users\" WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = ?

It currently doesn't test if the package was previously installed, so likely needs some tweaks (or a virtualenv, etc)\n- The local httpbin instance defaults to running on port 15261, so potentially local firewall rules may come into play.\n- Currently, only the plain http tests are pointed at the local httpbin. The ssl based tests still point at https://httpbin.org.\n\nTODO:\n- add setup/teardown of a https server for sitting in front of httpbin, since httpbin itself doesn't include any ssl support.\n\nNote: currently doesn't use a virtualenv, etc. Also, no\nhttps support yet.\n",

It also contains httpbin, and nginx so we get a full http/https/sni/httpbin/badssl type of testing capabilities.\n\nThe names such as `ansible.http.tests` is made available through docker linking, and reference the container running nginx/httpbin.\n\nIf desired we can pull the docker image in from https://github.com/sivel/docker-images/tree/master/httptester and make it available from `ansible/ansible:httptester` or similar.\n\nIt will probably take a while for the builds to complete.

      "pr1.desc": "Major refactor primarily to make Series inherit from NDFrame\n\naffects #4080, #3862, #816, #3217, #3386, #4463, #4204, #4118 , #4555\n\nPreserves pickle compat\nvery few tests were changed (and only for compat on return objects)\na few performance enhancements, a couple of regressions (see bottom)\n\n_obviously this is a large change in terms of the codebase, but it brings more consistency between series/frame/panel (not all of this is there yet, but future changes are much easier)_\n\n_Series is now like Frame in that it has a BlockManager (called SingleBlockManager), which holds a block (of any type we support). This introduced some overhead in doing certain operations, which I spent a lot of time optimizing away, further optimizations will come from cythonizing the core/internals, which should be straightforward at this point_\n\nHighlites below:\n\nIn 0.13.0 there is a major refactor primarily to subclass `Series` from `NDFrame`,\nwhich is the base class currently for `DataFrame` and `Panel`, to unify methods\nand behaviors. Series formerly subclassed directly from `ndarray`.\n- Refactor of series.py/frame.py/panel.py to move common code to generic.py\n  - added `_setup_axes` to created generic NDFrame structures\n  - moved methods\n    - `from_axes,_wrap_array,axes,ix,shape,empty,swapaxes,transpose,pop`\n    - `__iter__,keys,__contains__,__len__,__neg__,__invert__`\n    - `convert_objects,as_blocks,as_matrix,values`\n    - `__getstate__,__setstate__` (though compat remains in frame/panel)\n    - `__getattr__,__setattr__`\n    - `_indexed_same,reindex_like,align,where,mask,replace`\n    - `filter` (also added axis argument to selectively filter on a different axis)\n    - `reindex,reindex_axis` (which was the biggest change to make generic)\n    - `truncate` (moved to become part of `NDFrame`)\n- These are API changes which make `Panel` more consistent with `DataFrame`\n  - swapaxes on a Panel with the same axes specified now return a copy\n  - support attribute access for setting\n  - filter supports same api as original `DataFrame` filter\n- Reindex called with no arguments will now return a copy of the input object\n- Series now inherits from `NDFrame` rather than directly from `ndarray`.\n  There are several minor changes that affect the API.\n  - numpy functions that do not support the array interface will now\n    return `ndarrays` rather than series, e.g. `np.diff` and `np.where`\n  - `Series(0.5)` would previously return the scalar `0.5`, this is no\n    longer supported\n  - several methods from frame/series have moved to `NDFrame`\n    (convert_objects,where,mask)\n  - `TimeSeries` is now an alias for `Series`. the property `is_time_series`\n    can be used to distinguish (if desired)\n- Refactor of Sparse objects to use BlockManager\n  - Created a new block type in internals, `SparseBlock`, which can hold multi-dtypes\n    and is non-consolidatable. `SparseSeries` and `SparseDataFrame` now inherit\n    more methods from there hierarchy (Series/DataFrame), and no longer inherit\n    from `SparseArray` (which instead is the object of the `SparseBlock`)\n  - Sparse suite now supports integration with non-sparse data. Non-float sparse\n    data is supportable (partially implemented)\n  - Operations on sparse structures within DataFrames should preserve sparseness,\n    merging type operations will convert to dense (and back to sparse), so might\n    be somewhat inefficient\n  - enable setitem on `SparseSeries` for boolean/integer/slices\n  - `SparsePanels` implementation is unchanged (e.g. not using BlockManager, needs work)\n- added `ftypes` method to Series/DataFame, similar to `dtypes`, but indicates\n  if the underlying is sparse/dense (as well as the dtype)\n- All `NDFrame` objects now have a `_prop_attributes`, which can be used to indcated various\n  values to propogate to a new object from an existing (e.g. name in `Series` will follow\n  more automatically now)\n\nPerf changed a bit primarily in groupby where a Series has to be reconstructed in order to be passed to the function (in some cases). I basically pass a Series-like class to the grouped function to see if it doesn't raise, if its ok, then it is used rather than a full Series in order to reduce overhead of the Series creation for each group.\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ngroupby_multi_python                         | 109.3636 |  78.3370 |   1.3961 |\nframe_iteritems                              |   3.4664 |   2.0154 |   1.7200 |\nframe_fancy_lookup                           |   3.3991 |   1.6137 |   2.1064 |\nsparse_frame_constructor                     |  11.7100 |   5.3363 |   2.1944 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest name                                    | head[ms] | base[ms] |  ratio   |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTarget [c5d9495] : BUG: fix ujson handling of new series object\nBase   [1b91f4f] : BUG: Fixed non-unique indexing memory allocation issue with .ix/.loc (GH4280)\n```\n",

      "pr2.desc": "Reopening (and rebase) #21777 following a mistake during a merge....\r\n\r\nFollowing #20332 I've spent some time trying to improve the build process by switching to npm scripts only. See [comment](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/20332#issuecomment-273321645).\r\nMy analysis is that npm scripts, while looking incredibly simple in theory, present several constraints and that the [problems](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/20332#issue-166660947) of the build tool are not necessarly related to the tools but mostly the way tasks are organized and orchestrated.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to evaluate a solution that would make the build tool simpler to use, easier to maintain, robust and more importantly pleasant to use for developers, while building as much as possible on the existing that works.\r\n\r\nIt turns out it was not that hard and really fun to do :-), so after a couple hours the evaluation turned something that was almost there. So I decided to polish it, update the doc and propose a PR so anyone can can have a look.\r\nImage speak more than words so this is what I have now:\r\n\r\n![bootstrap-new-build](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3250552/22090498/088ea312-ddc0-11e6-8ab5-af5c51b4dd26.gif)\r\n\r\nHere is the improvement that this PR brings.\r\n\r\n#### Easy setup\r\n`npm install` and that's it.\r\n\r\n#### Simple to use\r\nOnly 3 commands for the user/developer:\r\n- `dist`: build JS, CSS and Docs.\r\n- `test`: build JS, CSS, Docs, test and lint.\r\n- `watch`: Start everything to dev efficiently.\r\n\r\nOnly 4 commands for the maintainer:\r\n- `prep-release`: prepare release.\r\n- `publish`: publish doc on GitHub.\r\n- `change-version`: update version in source files.\r\n- `update-shrinkwrap`: update shrinkwrap dependencies management.\r\n\r\n#### Pleasant to develop with\r\n`npm run watch`, Open your browser and voila! All changes made in scss, js and docs are automatically reflected in live on the local doc website. See gif above :)\r\n\r\n#### Fast\r\n- `build` runs in **6s** (it used to be 24s)\r\n- `test` runs in **20s**\r\n- `watch` react to a modification of js, scss or docs files, handle everything\r\n and reload the docs on the browser **in about 1s** (it used to be up to 10s just for sass + time for Jekyll to process the change)\r\n\r\n#### Easier to maintain\r\n- `Gruntfile` is now **10 line of code** and shouldn't have to be modified anymore.\r\n- For **each task there is a short declarative config file** under `build/grunt`.\r\n- Grunt tasks have been reorganized in a more logical way and can be found in `build/grunt/aliases.js`.\r\n- **No more custom JS script**.\r\n- **No more Javascript function** here and there (like in current `Gruntfile.js`).\r\n- Most of the Javascript code has been eliminated. Only the meaningful configuration remains in `build/grunt` and `build/grunt/aliases.js` and is  written in a more declarative way than it would in an npm script.\r\n\r\n#### Stable\r\n- Most of the individual tasks are the one Bootstrap has been running for a while now, so that limit the risk of regression.\r\n- All the Grunt plugins are reliable and well maintained plugins (often more up to date than some npm cli equivalent).\r\n\r\n#### How do I use it?\r\n- `git clone -b build-rework https://github.com/vanduynslagerp/bootstrap`\r\n- `cd bootstrap`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `npm run watch`\r\n- Open you browser to [localhost:9001](localhost:9001)\r\n- Start coding! Each modification is applied within 1s and the doc website is reloaded automatically. Just code and watch the result live.\r\n\r\nI understand the Bootstrap team, like many others, seems to desire to move to pure npm scripts. That said, I think I reached a pretty satisfying result, that worth to be evaluated, which is the point of this PR.",

I'm not sure how to deal with that.\n\nIn test/parallel/test-crypto.js the message is changed from \"asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag\" to \"asn1 encoding routines:asn1_check_tlen:wrong tag\".  (The function name in openssl got renamed from all capital letters to small letters.)\n\nIn test/parallel/test-tls-junk-server.js, the error message changed from \"/unknown protocol/\" to \"/wrong version number/\".\n\nIt also fixes 3 current issues with the test suite against the 1.0.2 version.\n\nWhen building against the 1.1.0 version there are various tests that fail.  There are a total of 11 test failures.\n\nSome tests assumes the TLS ticket is 48 bytes.  This was always just an implementation details and you could already ask OpenSSL what the size was.  The encryption got changed from AES128 to AES256 in 1.1.0 and so the size changed. I have no idea how to get that size to the right places in the test suite.\n\nSome of the other failures are related to ciphers that are disabled by default.  For instance anonymous ciphers like AECDH are disabled and you need to enable them by selecting a different security level, which can for instance be done by adding `@SECLEVEL=0` to the cipher list, but that's not compatible with the 1.0.x version.  Ciphers like 3DES and RC4 are disabled by default.\n\nOther tests fails because the key size that's used is too small.\n\nI'm not sure yet why some of the other tests fail.\n\nThere are also a bunch of warnings about deprecated functions.  I left them like they are.  The proper way to deal with it will probably break compatibility.\n\nPS: During make test I'm getting invalid opcode traps, this seems unrelated to my changes and doesn't seem to cause test suite failures.\n",

It breaks API/ABI compatibilities with 1.0.2 so that it needs semver-major in this upgrade.\r\n\r\nI submit this patch for intending to show and demonstrate that upgrading to 1.1.0 can be done in all platforms. CI results has already shown in https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-commit/8424/ and they are green except FreeBSD failure due to Jenkins error.\r\n\r\nBefore we make the decision, I think that the following three major issues should be discussed.\r\n\r\n1. Support end difference between Node LTS and OpenSSL\r\n\r\n   Node-v8 LTS Maintenance End will be in 2020-04. According to the current support policy of OpenSSL of https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html , it says that\r\n   ```\r\n   Version 1.0.2 will be supported until 2019-12-31 (LTS).\r\n   Version 1.1.0 will be supported until 2018-08-31.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   If we continue to use openssl-1.0.2, Node-v8 LTS support should be end on 2019-12-31 about 3 months earlier than our plan as we did in v0.12.\r\n   1.1.0 will be support end in the next year. A new OpenSSL-1.1.1 is now under development and expected to be released near future with new feature of TLS1.3. It is API/ABI compatible with 1.1.0 so we can deploy it with semver-minor. A new OpenSSL release will be supported at least two years. If LTS is specified to it, it will be five years support.\r\n   If we deployed 1.1.0 in Node-v8, we need to make semver-minor upgrade of OpenSSL until to meet its support end of 2020-04.\r\n\r\n2. FIPS Support\r\n   \r\n   The current FIPS support is provided only for 1.0.2. There was an announcement of a sponsor to support FIPS compliance with OpenSSL 1.1 in\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/07/20/fips/ but it is not yet to known when new FIPS support is released.\r\n\r\n   If FIPS support is required in Node, we have to continue to use 1.0.2 until new FIPS support is released.\r\n\r\n3. New Build Requirement (nasm) on Windows\r\n\r\n   In order to build OpenSSL in Windows with asm support, NASM is officially required. https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_0-stable/NOTES.WIN#L20-L23\r\n   ```\r\n   - Netwide Assembler, a.k.a. NASM, available from http://www.nasm.us,\r\n     is required if you intend to utilize assembler modules. Note that NASM\r\n     is the only supported assembler. The Microsoft provided assembler is NOT\r\n     supported.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   It was noted even in 1.0.2 and we have been ignoring this requirement. 1.1.0 begins to checks its requirement during build. We can avoid it with our own risk but I don't think it is a good way to go.   As it is inevitable, we should decide when and what version of Node the new requirement starts.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an experimental support of OpenSSL-1.1.0e with a new flag `--use-openssl11` in configure and contines to use 1.0.2 by default. I think that it leads API complexities when we add a new feature specific to 1.1.0 and agree that it is not a good solution.\r\n\r\nMy preference is that we stay on 1.0.2 in Node-v8 and deploy 1.1.0 or 1.1.1 someday later in v9 or v10 with replacing 1.0.2. If FIPS support is not released at that time. we separate a new branch with 1.0.2 only to have FIPS support.\r\n\r\nCC @nodejs/crypto , @nodejs/lts",

The only exception was needed for `filters` as JavaScript does not support filters, in this case, a filter is transformed into a `CallExpression` that has an extra property named `filter` with the value of `true`. This phase is heavily based on the previous implementation of `$parse`.\n\nThe AST processing phase transforms the AST into a function that can be executed to evaluate the expression. The logic for expressions remains unchanged. The AST processing phase works in two different ways depending if csp is enabled or disabled. If csp is enabled, the processing phase returns pre-generated function that interpret specific parts of the AST.\nWhen csp is disabled, then the entire expression is compiled into a single function that is later evaluated using `Function`. In both cases, the returning function has the properties `constant`, `literal` and `inputs` as in the previous implementation. These are used in the next phase to perform different optimizations.\n\nThe cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations phase remains mostly unchanged.\n\n[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API\n",

Suppose I want to auto-tag all of my voters and event subscribers\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# current\r\nservices:\r\n    _defaults:\r\n        autowire: true\r\n\r\n    _instanceof:\r\n        Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Authorization\\Voter\\VoterInterface:\r\n            tags: [security.voter]\r\n\r\n        Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\EventSubscriberInterface:\r\n            tags: [kernel.event_subscriber]\r\n\r\n    # services using the above tags\r\n    AppBundle\\Security\\PostVoter: ~\r\n    AppBundle\\EventListener\\CheckRequirementsSubscriber: ~\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I'm registering a service with a class that implements `VoterInterface`, when would I ever *not* want that to be tagged with `security.voter`? Here's the proposed code:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# proposed\r\nservices:\r\n    _defaults:\r\n        autowire: true\r\n        autoconfigure: true\r\n\r\n    # services using the auto_configure_instanceof functionality\r\n    AppBundle\\Security\\PostVoter: ~\r\n    AppBundle\\EventListener\\CheckRequirementsSubscriber: ~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user must opt into this and it only applies locally to this configuration file. It works because each enabled bundle would have the opportunity to add one or more \"automatic instanceof\" definitions - e.g. SecurityBundle would add the `security.voter` instanceof config, FrameworkBundle would add the `kernel.event_subscriber` instanceof config, etc.\r\n\r\nFor another example, you can check out the proposed changes to `symfony-demo` - symfony/symfony-demo#483 - the `_instanceof` section is pretty heavy: https://github.com/hhamon/symfony-demo/blob/81694ac21e63bebe7ecfa22fa689766f2f38ccd5/app/config/services.yml#L20\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

      "pr2.desc": "For the 'property values' that corresponds to a property path in PropertyAccessor::readPropertiesUntil() method, if current element's 'IS_REF' flag is true, it means and only means that it is passed as a reference to its immediate parent in the property path.\n\nIt does not guarantee that current element's reference will be automatically escalated to the top, because if there is an element, which is passed by value, stands in its way of going back to the top, the reference chain will be broken.\n\nHowever, a broken reference chain does NOT necessarily break the reference itself.\n\nThere are actually two scenarios:\n1. Current element is an object: this won't break the object's reference, because object is always passed as reference, even if the array that holds it is copied, the object is still copied as reference.\n2. Current element is an array element: this will also break the reference, because when copying an array, the array elements are copied as values instead of references. This means, at this point, the top element is referring to a different \"current element\". In order to escalate current element back to the top, its values must be copied explicitly.\n\nThe original code of PropertyAccessor does not recognize the 2nd senario, so it will raise issues in method setValue() and isWritable().\n\nLet's explain this issue with some examples:\n\n``` php\n// example 1\n\nclass Foo\n{\n    protected $value;\n\n    public function getValue()\n    {\n        return $this->value;\n    }\n\n    public function setValue($value)\n    {\n        $this->value = $value;\n    }\n\n    public function __construct($value)\n    {\n       $this->value = $value;\n    }\n}\n\n$pa = new PropertyAccessor();\n\n$b = new Foo('old-value');\n$a = new Foo(\n    array(\n       'a' => array(\n           'b' => array(\n               'c' => $b\n           )\n       )\n    )\n)\n\n$pa->setValue($a, 'value[a][b][c].value', 'new-value');\n// The reference chain is broken at $a.value, because array is\n// passed as value. But since $a.value[a][b][c].value is an object,\n// which is always passed as reference, the refernce itself is not broken,\n// the original code base works and the value of $a.value[a][b][c].value\n// will be changed to 'new-value'\n```\n\n``` php\n// example 2.\n\nclass Foo\n{\n    protected $value;\n\n    public function getValue()\n    {\n        return $this->value;\n    }\n\n    public function setValue($value)\n    {\n        $this->value = $value;\n    }\n\n    public function __construct($value)\n    {\n       $this->value = $value;\n    }\n}\n\n$a = new Foo(\n    array(\n        'a' => array(\n            'b' => 'old-value'\n        )\n    )\n);\n\n$pa = new PropertyAccessor();\n\n$pa->setValue($a, 'value[a][b]', 'new-value');\n\n// The reference chain is broken at $a.value, because array is\n// passed as value and the reference of $a.value[a][b] is broken as\n// well, because when $a.value is copied, $a.value[a][b] is passed by\n// value as well.\n// But the original code base does not recognize this scenario and will\n// terminate the process earlier, which will fail to update the value of\n// $a.value[a][b]\n\n```\n\nThis issue is caused by the incorrect use of 'IS_REF' flag: the original\ncode base only use the 'IS_REF' flag to identify reference element, but\nit does not care if it's an object or array element. For object, it's\nsafe to terminate the process earlier, but for array element, we should\nnot terminate the process unless we can confirm that its reference chain\nis not broken - all of its ancient elements in the property path are\npassed by reference.\n\nThis issue affects both the setValue() and the isWritable() methods.\n\nSo we need introduce a new flag, 'IS_REF_CHAINED', to identify an\nelement that is passed as reference and all its ancient elements in\nthe property path are also passed as reference.\n\nAnd we can terminate the process as follows:\n1. If current element is an object, then it's safe to terminate the value setting process here because object is always passed as reference.\n2. If current element is not an object and its 'IS_REF_CHAINED' flag is true, then it's safe to terminate the value setting process, because all the acient elements in the property path are referring\n   to this object as reference, so there is no need to copy values.\n3. Otherwise, we should not terminate the value setting process here,\n   so that the element value can be copied explicitly later.\n   \n   | Q | A |\n   | --- | --- |\n   | Bug fix? | yes |\n   | New feature? | no |\n   | BC breaks? | no |\n   | Deprecations? | no |\n   | Tests pass? | yes |\n   | Fixed tickets | n/a |\n   | License | MIT |\n   | Doc PR | n/a |\n",

It's not perfect, but given the above constraint, I think this is an acceptable trade-of.\n\nSo, several use cases:\n- Using the default handler (no change);\n- Using a custom handler that implements `AuthenticationSuccessHandlerInterface` directly and does not need any options (no change);\n- Using a custom handler that needs the options/provider key (that's the new use case this PR supports).\n\nThis PR introduces 2 new classes that wrap custom handlers. If those classes define the `setOptions()` and/or `setProviderKey()` methods, they are automatically called with the correct arguments. Yours handler does not need to extend the default handler `DefaultAuthentication*Handler`, but doing so helps as the setters are already defined there.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "### Issue\n\nThere is a phpcs issue with the signature of `JHtmlSelect::suggestionlist()`. It contains a required `$idtag` after the optional `$optkey` and `$optText`, which essentially makes those two required as well.\n\nFixing this correct is basically not possible without creating a new function and proxy it.\n\nThe produced datalist also has some errors in it.\n### Solution\n- This PR will deprecate `JHtmlSelect::suggestionlist()` which was introduced with J3.2 to implement the `<datalist>` tag into the text formfield.\n- The datalist will be created directly in the `getInput()` function of the formfield instead. It's a very simple code and the current usage of `JHtmlSelect::options()` within `JHtmlSelect::suggestionlist()` to generate the items created more problems and was basically overkill.\n- Deprecated `getSuggestions()` in the text formfield and replaced it with `getOptions()` like we use in every other formfield. `getSuggestions()` is proxied to `getOptions()` in case someone was extending the class and actually used it.\n### Testing\n\nAdd some options to a text field and see if the datalist works. For example change the title for the article form to\n\n```\n        <field name=\"title\" type=\"text\" label=\"JGLOBAL_TITLE\"\n            description=\"JFIELD_TITLE_DESC\"\n            class=\"input-xxlarge input-large-text\"\n            size=\"40\"\n            required=\"true\" \n            >\n            <option>Option1</option>\n            <option value=\"Value2\">Option2</option>\n            <option value=\"Value3\" />\n        </field>\n```\n\nIt should show a list with \"suggestions\" as soon as you start typing or click into the field.\nPlease note that the first option will not show because there is no value given. The second option will show with both the value and the text, depending on browser (Chrome shows the text rigth aligned a bit smaller). The third option will show the value only.\n#### Remarks\n\nThis is based on a Codestyle PR and some discussions we had after it.\nUnfortunately I forgot to do the PR then and now can't find the discussion anymore.\n",

Because the string only behavior was enforced by the transformer tests this is a BC change. (Personally I think that this is not a BC break that would cause problems).\n\nAnother possible fix is to add a normalizer for the `empty_data` option and transform a int or float to a LocalizedString but that looks/feels like a bad patch job.\n\nI hope this PR will have less people going through there validation schema just to figure out that it's the `NumberToLocalizedStringTransformer` causing the problem.\n",

Included are the standard GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThan, LessThanOrEqual and Equal. e.g.:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @assert:GreaterThan({\"diedDate\", \"bornDate\"})\n * @assert:LessThanOrEqual({\"bornDate\", \"firstSchoolDayDate\", \"diedDate\"})\n */\nclass Person\n{\n    private $bornDate;\n    private $firstSchoolDayDate;\n    private $diedDate;\n}\n```\n\nI think it would also be useful if they worked on a property level rather than just class. I'm not sure what the default option should be though. e.g. is there a reliable way to determine what's a raw value and what's a property name:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/** @assert:GreaterThan(80) */\nprivate $iq;\n/** @assert:LessThan('dateDied') */\nprivate $bornDate;\n/** @assert:LessThanOrEqual('C') */\nprivate $grade;\n/** @assert:GreaterThanOrEqual({50, 'ageStartedSchool'}) */\nprivate $age;\n```\n",

Build any sql query using instances of `JDatabaseQuery` using various database types.\n2. Build query which also uses `union` or `unionAll` or both of them.\n3. Build query which uses `union` or `unionAll` as well as `order`.\n\nYou can use the following sample query as a hint what you need to test.\n\n``` php\n$db    = JFactory::getDbo();\n$query = $db->getQuery(true);\n$query->select('a.id')\n    ->from('#__content AS a')\n    ->union('SELECT c.id FROM #__content AS c')\n    ->unionAll('SELECT d.id FROM #__content AS d')\n    ->order('id');\n```\n\nshould give\n\n``` sql\nSELECT a.id\nFROM is2_content AS a\nUNION (SELECT c.id FROM is2_content AS c)\nUNION ALL (SELECT d.id FROM is2_content AS d)\nORDER BY id\n```\n\nWithout this patch you get\n\n``` sql\nSELECT a.id\nFROM is2_content AS a\nORDER BY id\nUNION (SELECT c.id FROM is2_content AS c)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `UNION ALL  (SELECT d.id FROM is2_content AS d)` is missing also the order by clause comes before union which is wrong. \n\nFixes #7970\n",

The changes fall into three categories (thanks @nik9000 for the nice summary):\n- `public` methods on non-`public` classes don't make sense. Remove the modifier and let the method inherit the modifier.\n- try-with-resources variables should not be declared `final` because they are implicitly `final`. `final` adds no extra information for the reader. I guess that makes them names rather than variables....\n- `enum`s are alway `static` so there is no need to declare them `static`.\n- `final` doesn't do anything on anonymous classes because they can't be extended anyway. So we just remove the modifier.\n- Classes declared inside of interfaces are always `static` so we shouldn't also declare them as `static`.\n\nFor the record, most of the changes were automated using this small Bash script:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ninput=\"/tmp/violations.txt\"\n\n# File is composed of lines like:\n# /tmp/elasticsearch/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/action/Action.java:10:9:public\n# \nwhile IFS=':' read -ra ADDR; do\n    if [ \"${ADDR[3]}\" != \"\" ]; then\n        echo \"${ADDR[0]}\" | xargs sed -i \"${ADDR[1]}s/${ADDR[3]} //\"\n    else \n        echo \"Skipping file ${ADDR[0]} line ${ADDR[1]} word ${ADDR[3]}\"\n    fi\ndone < \"$input\"\n```\n\nCheckstyle was not updated to the latest version 7.1.2 because it reports violations for `final` parameters in interface methods (checkstyle/checkstyle#3322) and we have a lot of these for good reason.\n\nI'm really sorry for the boringness of this kind of pull request.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "This patch aims to resolve a lingering issue with Security Group Rules, \nwhere different resources generate rules that are consolidated on Amazon's \nside, as a result resulting in loss of local resources in the state file \nand duplication errors on AWS's side. \n\nExample:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"first\" {\n \u00a0 \u00a0type \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= \"ingress\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0from_port \u00a0 = 80\n \u00a0 \u00a0to_port \u00a0 \u00a0 = 80\n \u00a0 \u00a0protocol \u00a0 \u00a0= \"tcp\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.2.0/24\", \"10.0.3.0/24\"]\n\n \u00a0 security_group_id = \"${aws_security_group.nat.id}\"\n}\n```\n\nAfter applying this rule, our security group `nat` looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n  Description: \"Managed by Terraform\",\n  GroupId: \"sg-87eb46e3\",\n  GroupName: \"secg-nat\",\n  IpPermissions: [{\n      FromPort: 80,\n      IpProtocol: \"tcp\",\n      IpRanges: [{\n          CidrIp: \"10.0.2.0/24\"\n        },{\n          CidrIp: \"10.0.3.0/24\"\n        }],\n      ToPort: 80\n    }],\n  OwnerId: \"470663696735\",\n  VpcId: \"vpc-0806716d\"\n}\n```\n\nThis rule, with 2 `cidr_block` entires, is a single IPPermission rule according to the API.\n\nAt present, the Security Group Rule resource hashes it's values (ports, cidrs, security groups) \nto generate a key. This breaks down however, when another rule is added with a new `cidr_block`. \n\nNow, adding a second rule that also uses a `cidr_block` like so, will reveal the bug:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"second\" {\n \u00a0 \u00a0type \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= \"ingress\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0from_port \u00a0 = 80\n \u00a0 \u00a0to_port \u00a0 \u00a0 = 80\n \u00a0 \u00a0protocol \u00a0 \u00a0= \"tcp\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.5.0/24\"]\n\n \u00a0 security_group_id = \"${aws_security_group.nat.id}\"\n}\n```\n\nThe IPPermissions now look like this:\n\n```\nFull Security Group: {\n  Description: \"Managed by Terraform\",\n  GroupId: \"sg-87eb46e3\",\n  GroupName: \"secg-nat\",\n  IpPermissions: [{\n      FromPort: 80,\n      IpProtocol: \"tcp\",\n      IpRanges: [{\n          CidrIp: \"10.0.2.0/24\"\n        },{\n          CidrIp: \"10.0.3.0/24\"\n        },{\n          CidrIp: \"10.0.5.0/24\"\n        }],\n      ToPort: 80\n    }],\n  OwnerId: \"470663696735\",\n  VpcId: \"vpc-0806716d\"\n}\n```\n\nThe API has consolidated this new `cidr_block` into an existing rule, based on the port and \nprotocol it applies to. Because of the way Terraform hashes the rules locally, it can no longer find \neither resource, as it hashes the **entire IPPermission** looking for a match.\n\nThis pull request resolves this by iterating through `IpPermissions` and looking for matching criteria, \nensuring that each `cidr_block` or `security_group_id` is found in a set. \n\nThis patch also fixes another issue, where similar rules applied to different security groups caused the \nsame kind of conflict, because we were not hashing the security group id itself into the id of the rule. \nWe now consider the id in the hash for the rule to avoid this. \n\nRefs:\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2584#issuecomment-120088474\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2837\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/2463\n",

Examples:\n- Proxy to a pod's port: `/pods/foo/proxy/5000/some/resource`\n- Proxy to a service's port: `/services/foo/proxy/5000/some/resource/path`\n- Expose logs for a pod: `/pods/foo/logs?container=test` -> returns \"text/plain\" stream\n- Expose logs for a resource backed by a pod `/jobs/foo/logs` -> \n- Parameterize pod logs with query options: `/pods/foo/logs?container=test&since=30s`\n- Handle remote execution: `/pods/foo/exec?container=test&cmd=/bin/bash&arg=-c&arg=echo+$foo` -> upgrades connection to SPDY/HTTP2\n- Handle portforwarding: `/pods/foo/portforward/5000?container=test`\n- Allow binaries to be posted to an endpoint (with a given type) and converted by RESTStorage or apiserver into the underlying object - essentially hand off the request body to storage.\n\nThis requires three pieces of function:\n- Allow query parameters to be properly versioned across a set of distinct resources and verbs\n- Return an input stream from a RESTStorage Get or Post call\n- Upgrade an HTTP connection to a higher protocol (exec) or hijack it (port forward) or use it to proxy other requests (proxy)\n\nIdeally we would also ensure we have methods that allow proper introspection through swagger\n- Handle content type negotiation when returning an input stream\n- Annotate request parameters with metadata for query params\n\nThis pull request will contain the changes to enable that functionality through a set of targeted refactors.  @csrwng @lavalamp @bgrant0607 @liggitt\n",

Socket address generated in the version of etcd being used with kubernetes currently, contains '.' character whereas Go1.8 doesn't support '.' character in the socket address. So, latest 3.1.0 version of etcd resolved this problem by generating adresses which does not contain any '.' character. Kubernetes needs to update it's vendored etcd to 3.1.0 for the above mentioned reason. This pull request takes care of that.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Abhishek Dasgupta <a10gupta@linux.vnet.ibm.com>",

For example;\n\n``` ruby\ntravel 1.day do\n  Foo.do_something #This method depends on Time.now and it has mock value lets say A\n\n  travel 1.day do\n    Bar.do_another_thing #This method depends on Time.now and it has mock value lets say B\n  end\n\n  Zoo.do_yet_another_thing #This method depends on Time.now and it has mock value as A\nend\n```\n\nIn current implementation we can't use nested `travel` methods because when the execution of deepest `travel` method finishes `Time.now` returns back to original `Time.now`.\nLets see this in an example like above;\n\n``` ruby\ntravel 1.day do\n  Foo.do_something #This method depends on Time.now and it has mock value lets say A\n\n  travel 1.day do\n    Bar.do_another_thing #This method depends on Time.now and it has mock value lets say B\n  end\n\n  Zoo.do_yet_another_thing #This method depends on Time.now and it returns the original Time.now\nend\n```\n\nAs you can see we've expected that `Time.now` will return `A` but it returns original `Time.now`.\n",

This patch should fix this issue without affecting any other behavior. Issue was originally reported by user Cartho on joomla-bugs.de: http://www.joomla-bugs.de/forum/index.php/topic,665.0.html\n## Testing instructions\n1. Go to \"Menus - Your Menu\" in backend to see the list of menu items.\n2. Trash one or more menu items.\n3. Set the \"state\" filter to \"trashed\" or \"all\" to display trashed items.\n4. Apply the patch.\n5. Make sure the icon is now correct and all actions still work, in particular:\n   - \"untrash\" an item by clicking the trash icon.\n   - \"untrash\" one or more items by selecting some and clicking the \"clear trash\" button when the state filter is set to \"trashed\".\n   - trash one or more items by selecting some and clicking the \"trash\" button.\n## Further proposals\n\nAs mentioned, the patch only changes the icon. For reasons of consistency, I have two more proposals where I'd like to request for some comments:\n### 1) Change the tooltips\n\n  I'm not sure if the tooltips \"Publish menu item::Component disabled\" and \"Component disabled and menu item unpublished.\" are the correct ones to use for the \"trashed\" state (-2). \n### 2) Use the same state buttons as in com_content\n\n  In com_content (list of articles), we have a button group containing the status icon, featured icon and a dropdown with the actions \"trash\" and \"archive\". Is there any point against doing this the same way in com_menus?

Colour brewing is done manually so the only additional import required is `numpy`, and output is still pure dot format. \n\nEnhancements include:\n- Drawing leaf nodes at the base of the tree for clarity\n- Colours indicating how the node classification is 'leaning', including multi-class\n- Percentage samples shown in node instead of raw number of samples\n- Percentage per class shown for all nodes, not just leaves\n\nStandard output, omitting the new `pretty` and `simple` flags, should result in the exact same graphical output from Graphviz as the incumbent version, though the dot code has been altered slightly for simplicity given the new more complicated node representation for `pretty`.\n\nA few examples using the Titanic survivor dataset:\n\nno flags:\n\n![full_new](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514716/0a8c122a-4b88-11e4-92dd-78f78bbfcee9.png)\n\n`pretty`:\n\n![full_pretty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514717/154df71e-4b88-11e4-9d09-b763ebe63763.png)\n\n`pretty` & `simple`:\n\n![full_pretty_simple](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514718/20512c9e-4b88-11e4-88f7-6eb78fabec4d.png)\n\n`pretty` & `max_depth`:\n\n![cropped_pretty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5210848/4514721/3957a330-4b88-11e4-9544-78f68cab3da5.png)\n\nIt has been moderately tested on pure `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` objects, though I am well aware that regression needs work and will fail if attempted with the new flags (though the standard output still appears to be functional).\n\nTo be discussed:\n- How to represent colours for regression... I'm thinking a diverging colour scheme with white for the median or mean of the two most extreme values in the leaves should work well.\n- Should the text and graphical options be broken out further? Something like `show_major_class`, `use_colours`, `use_percentages`, etc., or some perhaps discarded. I based the options off the R package, that's not meant to imply that this is the state of the art, just the best I've stumbled across.\n- Should the base implementation even be maintained? The extra sub-tree recursion per node is a little expensive, but it's just a single tree... And seeing what each node is voting towards gives more intuitive information than the error coefficients alone. It even appears that this used to be standard output from the examples [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)\n\nOther options that might be useful:\n- Left to right orientation for use in reports?\n- Anything else you can think of? Though Graphviz is a little limited in what you can pull off\n- Welcome any other suggestions / gotchas\n",

It\r\nprobably takes a (neglible) performance hit but makes the code a bit\r\neasier to inspect/work with, as its closer to all other windows modules.\r\n\r\nOn a normal run, the action plugin does a local checksum of the source\r\nand a remote checksum of the destination. And afterwards, the module\r\nwill do another remote checksum of the copied source, a remote checksum\r\nof the original destination, and another remote checksum of the copied\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nOn a very huge file (think 4GB) that means **no less than 5x reading the\r\ncomplete file** *If you have a large cache you may get away with it, otherwise\r\nyou're doomed !*\r\n\r\nThis patch will ensure with `force: no` that no checksums are being\r\nperformed by the action plugin and the module. We do this by delaying\r\nthe checksum calls until we have determined whether the destination in\r\nfact exists.

I like how MDN documents the formal syntax of CSS rules. For instance, the formal syntax of the `box-shadow` rule is as follows (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#Formal_syntax):\n\n```\nnone | [inset? && [ <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius>? <spread-radius>? <color>? ] ]#\n```\n\nUsing this for helpers you could have something as follows for `{{each}}`:\n\n```\n{{each <array> [itemViewClass=\"<item-view-class>\"]? [emptyViewClass=\"<empty-view-class>\"]? [itemController=\"<item-controller>\"]? as |<item>|}}\n```\n\nIn any case, correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that in their current format, the documentation of the parameters are particularly useful to most of the Ember.js users.\n",

      "pr1.desc": "Until now we built add-ons by pointing node-gyp at the src/ directory.\r\nWe've had at least one DOA release where add-ons were broken because of\r\na header dependency issue that wasn't caught because we build our test\r\nadd-ons in a non-standard way.\r\n\r\nThis commit does the following:\r\n\r\n* Use tools/install.py to install the headers to test/addons/include.\r\n* Add a script to build everything in test/addons.\r\n* Remove the pile-up of hacks from the Makefile.\r\n\r\nThe same logic is applied to test/addons-napi and test/gc.\r\n\r\nEverything is done in parallel as much as possible to speed up builds.\r\nIdeally, we derive the level of parallelism from MAKEFLAGS but it lacks\r\nthe actual `-j<n>` flag.  That's why it simply spawns as many processes\r\nas there are processors for now.\r\n\r\nThe exception is tools/doc/addon-verify.js: I switched it to synchronous\r\nlogic to make it easy to use from another script. Since it takes no time\r\nat all to do its work, that seemed like a reasonable trade-off to me.\r\n\r\nRefs: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11628\r\nCI: https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request/7225/",

In dealing with this error, the whole port_path var is then asserted as an INT and set as the 'port' value. This obviously throws a module failure as the port value still has a slash in it - i.e. '2000/'\r\n\r\nTo get around this I've added a check that will set 'path' as a slash if the path var appears empty, therefore the format will still work and the error isn't thrown which would result in an incorrect INT assertion.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste verbatim command output below, e.g. before and after your change -->\r\n**Before:**\r\n```\r\nAn exception occurred during task execution.

We currently fail the cat request when the user specifies a concrete index as parameter that does not exist. The implementation works as intended in that regard. It checks this not only for the first cluster state request, but also the subsequent indices stats one. This means that if the index is deleted before the cat action has queried the indices stats, it rightfully fails. In case the user provides wildcards (or no parameter at all), however, we fail the indices stats as we pass the resolved concrete indices to the indices stats request and fail to distinguish whether these indices have been resolved by wildcards or explicitly requested by the user. This means that if an index has been deleted before the indices stats request gets to execute, we fail the overall cat request (see #17395).

Build any sql query using instances of `JDatabaseQuery` using various database types.\n2. Build query which also uses `union` or `unionAll` or both of them.\n3. Build query which uses `union` or `unionAll` as well as `order`.\n\nYou can use the following sample query as a hint what you need to test.\n\n``` php\n$db    = JFactory::getDbo();\n$query = $db->getQuery(true);\n$query->select('a.id')\n    ->from('#__content AS a')\n    ->union('SELECT c.id FROM #__content AS c')\n    ->unionAll('SELECT d.id FROM #__content AS d')\n    ->order('id');\n```\n\nshould give\n\n``` sql\nSELECT a.id\nFROM is2_content AS a\nUNION (SELECT c.id FROM is2_content AS c)\nUNION ALL (SELECT d.id FROM is2_content AS d)\nORDER BY id\n```\n\nWithout this patch you get\n\n``` sql\nSELECT a.id\nFROM is2_content AS a\nORDER BY id\nUNION (SELECT c.id FROM is2_content AS c)\n```\n\nPlease note that the `UNION ALL  (SELECT d.id FROM is2_content AS d)` is missing also the order by clause comes before union which is wrong. \n\nFixes #7970\n",

In any case it allows numpy vectorised operations, as used here when calculating the mean score for each parameter setting (in `_aggregate_scores`).\n\nGiven this data, the legacy `grid_scores_` (already deprecated), `best_params_` and `best_scores_` are calculated as properties.\n\nThis approach is extensible to new fields, in particular new fields within `fold_results_` records, which are compiled from dicts returned from `fit_fold` (formerly `fit_grid_point`).\n\nThis PR is cut back from #1768; there you can see this extensibility exemplified to store training scores, training and test times, and precision and recall together with F-score.\n",

This is a proof-of-concept prototype to start conversation :), it is not meant to be pulled.\n\nWhat do i mean by grouping?\nLets say i have 4 Documents:\n{ \"id\" : 1, \"name\": \"Doc1\", \"field\" : \"A\" }\n{ \"id\" : 2, \"name\": \"Doc2\", \"field\" : \"A\" }\n{ \"id\" : 3, \"name\": \"Doc3\", \"field\" : \"B\" }\n{ \"id\" : 4, \"name\": \"Doc4\", \"field\" : \"B\" }\nI want to execute search that is something like this:\n{ \"query\": { \"match_all\" : {}, \"group\", \"field\" }\nWith result:\n{ \"field\" : {\n    \"A\" : { \"hits\" : { \"id\" : 1, \"_source\" : { \"id\" : 1, \"name\": \"Doc1\", \"field\" : \"A\" } },\n                           { \"id\" : 2, \"_source\" : { \"id\" : 2, \"name\": \"Doc2\", \"field\" : \"A\" } }\n             },\n    \"B\" : { \"hits\" : { \"id\" : 3, \"_source\" : { \"id\" : 3, \"name\": \"Doc3\", \"field\" : \"B\" } },\n                           { \"id\" : 4, \"_source\" : { \"id\" : 4, \"name\": \"Doc4\", \"field\" : \"B\" } }\n            }\n}\n\nImplementation.\nFirst i looked at lucene-grouping module, but later decided to make a simple (slower?) one-pass solution based on Facets. Basically, in aggregator i collect docs in maps, and later - sort them and merge into one map.\n\nThe code is a work-in-progress for now, because i was unable to fit nicely it into current hierarchy (SearchPhaseController operates only with flat ScoreDocs array, or i have to reimplement whole Search stack from sratch).\nAny thought?\n\nThank!\n",

      "pr1.desc": "The `top_hits` aggregator keeps track of the most relevant document being aggregated. This aggregator should be used as a sub aggregator of a bucket based aggregator, so that the top documents per bucket are computed.\n\nVia this aggregator [grouping / field collapsing](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/256) can be achieved and is very versatile. Someone can group by a field (using a terms aggregator as parent) or by time (using a histogram aggregator as parent), in any case the parent bucket aggregator determines how to group. How correct the top hits will depend on the parent aggregator. For example when using the `terms` aggregator and the `top_hits` aggregator some document may not end up in the response, because the `shard_size` on the `terms` aggregator is less then the field's cardinality.\n\nThe `top_hits` aggregator should have the following options:\n- `size` - The amount of hits to collect.\n- `sort` - Defines how the top hits should be sorted.\n- and any other fetch phase options. Like source filtering and highlighting.\n\nThe prototype that is attached right now to this PR integrates nicely with the fetch phase, which allows all fetch like features to be implemented easily. Also it executes as if the `search_type` is set to `query_and_fetch`, this way aggregations don't need to execute extra round trips. \n\nExample usage of the current prototype:\n\n``` json\nGET /stack/question/_search?search_type=count\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"terms\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"tags\",\n        \"size\": 10\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"top_tag_hits\": {\n          \"top_hits\": {\n            \"_source\": {\n              \"include\": [\n                \"title\"\n              ]\n            },\n            \"sort\": [\n              {\n                \"last_activity_date\": {\n                  \"order\": \"desc\"\n                }\n              }\n            ],\n            \"size\" : 3\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example the hits are sorted by the field `last_activity_date` and only the top 3 hits are returned. Also per hit only the `title` field is included.\n\nResponse:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"took\": 151,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n

On the other hand,\nthe __init__ of BaseSearchCV does not accept return_train_score as an optional keyword.  As a result, there was no way to have the results_ attribute receving train score.\n\nThe fix is to add the keyword return_train_score to the __init__ of BaseSearchCV (which is inherited by both GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV).  Default is still set to False.  When return_train_score is set to True, a set of addition steps is taken to put train_score into results_\n\nThe timing information is always available but was not written into \"results_\".  This patch also writes timing info into results_ by default.\n#### Any other comments?\n\nTest is also re-written.  In the test I explicitly choose return_train_score=True for better coverage.\n\n<!--\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome.

This made it possible to fix several tickets, as indicated above.\n\n**Usage**\n\nSee [the updated documentation](https://github.com/webmozart/symfony-docs/blob/issue11705/components/options_resolver.rst).\n\n**Bug Fixes**\n\nPreviously, the options weren't validated before the normalizers were called. As a result, the normalizers had to perform validation again:\n\n``` php\n$resolver->setAllowedTypes(array(\n    'choices' => 'array',\n));\n$resolver->setNormalizers(array(\n    'choices' => function (Options $options, $value) {\n         array_merge($options['choices'], ...);\n    },\n));\n\n// fatal error\n$resolver->resolve(array('choices' => 'foobar'));\n```\n\nThis is fixed now.\n\n**BC Breaks**\n\nThe `array` type hint was removed from `setRequired()`, `setAllowedValues()`, `addAllowedValues()`, `setAllowedTypes()` and `addAllowedTypes()`. If anybody implemented `OptionsResolverInterface`, they must adapt their code.\n\nThe Options class was turned into an interface extending ArrayAccess and Countable. Anybody instantiating Options directly should instantiate OptionsResolver instead. Anybody using any of the methods available in Options (`get()`, `has()`) should use the ArrayAccess interface instead.\n\nNormalizers are not called anymore for undefined options (#9174). People need to set a default value if they want a normalizer to be executed independent of the options passed to `resolve()`.\n\n**Deprecations**\n\nOptionsResolverInterface was deprecated and will be removed in 3.0. OptionsResolver instances are not supposed to be shared between classes, hence an interface does not make sense.\n\nSeveral other methods were deprecated. See the CHANGELOG and UPGRADE-2.6 files for information.\n\n**Todo**\n- [x] Fix PHPDoc\n- [x] Adapt CHANGELOG/UPGRADE\n- [x] Adapt documentation\n- [x] Deprecate OptionsResolver[Interface]\n",

This creates another BC issue though in that it changes the InputInterface. I don't think that's a major concern but it's worth mentioning.\n\nThe other only minor BC change is if you do getParameterOption() of a flag option i.e. `--foo` without a value. Before it was returning null in ArgvInput and true in ArrayInput. I normalized this to true for both since I think that makes more sense, but strictly speaking while it improves interface interchangeability, it's a BC break.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "The Netty 4 HTTP server pipeline tests contains two different test\ncases. The general idea behind these tests is to submit some requests to\na Netty 4 HTTP server, one test with pipelining enabled and another test\nwith pipelining disabled. These requests are submitted to two endpoints,\none with a path like /{id} and another with a path like /slow with a\nquery string parameter sleep. This parameter tells the request handler\nhow long to sleep for before replying. The idea is that in the case of\nthe pipelining enabled tests, the requests should come back exactly in\nthe order submitted, even with some of the requests hitting the slow\nendpoint with random sleep durations; this is the guarantee that\npipelining provides. And in the case of the pipelining disabled tests,\nrequests were randombly submitted to /{id} and /slow with sleep\nparameters starting at 600ms and increasing by 100ms for each slow\nrequest constructed. We would expect the requests to come back with the\nall the responses to the /{id} requests first because these requests\nwill execute instantaneously, and then the responses to the /slow\nrequests. Further, it was expected that the slow requests would come\nback ordered by the length of the sleep, the thinking being that 100ms\nshould be enough of a difference between each request that we would\navoid any race conditions. Sadly, this is not the case, the threads do\nsometimes hit race conditions.\n\nThis commit modifies the HTTP server pipelining tests to address this\nrace condition. The modification is that the query string parameter on\nthe /slow endpoint is removed in favor of just submitting requests to\nthe path /slow/{id}, where id just used a marker to distinguish each\nrequest. The server chooses a random sleep of at least 500ms for each\nrequest on the slow path. The assertion here then is that the /{id}\nresponses arrive first, then then /slow responses. We can not make an\nassertion on the order of the responses, but we can assert that we did\nsee every expected response.\n",

This should ease the comparison of role strings and instances of `Role` itself. For example, in the `FOSUserBundle` the `User` model contains roles which are represented as strings. This makes comparisons between arrays of `Role` objects and role strings difficult without creating your own `Role` class with a `__toString()`,  and this isn't always desirable.\n\nI found some conversation around [adding the `\\Seriazable` interface to the `Role` class](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/4934), and I realise that this might also be considered a BC break if people are relying on the fact that it will not cast to a string.\n",

I believe the file it is referring to is actually `mysql/3.5.0-2015-07-01.sql` (note the different date).\n2.  As noted in the errors above, Numerous columns are reported as having an incorrect type.  The SQL file attempts to set the type to `varchar(191)`, but the actual type found in the database is `varchar(255)`.  So the SQL file is obviously not being applied properly (hence the errors).  But that also raises the point that the default schema (`installation/sql/mysql/joomla.sql`) needs updating so that the columns at issue are created as `varchar(191)`, not `varchar(255)`.\n",

      "pr1.desc": "Fixes gh-5179\n# Technical description\n\nThe libraries/classmap.php file registers class aliases with JLoader. This works fine when a developer creates an object using the old class name (e.g. JRegistry) instead of the new class (e.g. Joomla\\Registry\\Registry). However, this causes an issue when PHP doesn't try to autoload a class, e.g. when the old class name is in the right hand side of instanceof. Example:\n\n`$foo = new \\Joomla\\Registry\\Registry();\nvar_dump($foo instanceof \\Joomla\\Registry\\Registry); // returns true\nvar_dump($foo instanceof JRegistry); // returns false`\n\nHowever, if you have forced the autoloader to run you have no problem. Example:\n\n`$foo = new \\Joomla\\Registry\\Registry();\nclass_exists('JRegistry', true); // Dummy line just to force the autoloader to run\nvar_dump($foo instanceof \\Joomla\\Registry\\Registry); // returns true\nvar_dump($foo instanceof JRegistry); // returns true now!!!`\n\nWe can't use static `class_alias()` calls because PHP needs to load the original class, causing memory and performance issues. Instead, we need a way to create the aliases on-the-fly, when either then old class is loaded (via the dynamic alias set in JLoader) or through the new namespaced class name (through Composer).\n\nThis patch uses a fork of the `\\Composer\\Autoload\\ClassLoader` class which calls `JLoader::applyAliasFor($class)` when loading a class. This allows us to register class aliases on the fly, when the new, namespaced class is being loaded. Moreover, the same trick is applied to all of the JLoader autoloaders. This results in perfect backwards compatibility while we are proceeding with the namespacing of the core code.\n# Backwards compatibility\n\nThis patch actually _fixes_ backwards compatibility :)\n# Performance impact\n\nI could not measure performance impact, not because of lack or try or incompetence but because of variance. Therefore I conclude that the performance impact is statistically not important. In layman's terms: it's so small you can't even separate it from the variance in page load times added by external factors such as filesystem caches, code caches, web server thread management etc.\n\nAs for the memory impact, it is about 0.2Kb per aliased class. Even with hundreds of classes the memory impact is miniscule compared to the core code memory footprint.\n",

'/js/template.js');\n```\n\nExample to specify the asset version manually:\n\n``` PHP\n$doc->addScriptVersion('templates/' . $this->template . '/js/template.js', '1,87');\n```\n\nThe automatic version is generated only:\n- When the user session is created\n- On each page load when debug is enabled.\n\nSo in the normal mode it would be created only 1 time per user session instead of 1 per page load. The version is built with:\n\n``` PHP\n$mediaTag = md5($this->getLongVersion() . $config->get('secret') . $date->toSql());\n```\n\nIt uses Joomla! version + secret string in configuration + current date + time.\n\nIt also includes one extra check to not add mediatag to assets that already contain it. So in most cases in can directly replace <code>addScript</code> & <code>addStylesheet</code> methods.\n\nThis modifies JFactory to add the mediatag on document creation. I saw that JFactory is already using JVersion so it doesn't add additional dependencies. But with this same method we can do it outside JFactory (for example inside a template) with:\n\n``` PHP\n$doc->setMediatag('23424235346456');\n```\n\nAnyone can flush assets cache with:  \n\n``` PHP\n$app = JFactory::getApplication()->flushAssets();\n```\n\nThis pull request already includes the code to refresh assets in:\n1. In <code>finaliseUpgrade()</code> method triggered after upgrading joomla.\n2. In the extension installer after <code>install()</code>, <code>discover_install()</code> &  <code>uninstall()</code> methods.\n\nFeature tracker issue:\nhttp://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=31602\n\nGoogle group discussion (please send your comments there to avoid duplicated discussions):\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/joomla-dev-cms/81ZQ94MCV9A\n",

      "pr2.desc": "### Why can't I specify TTL ?\n\nSince I remember working with code-level cache solutions there was always an easy method to specify TTL on per-item basis. It is a [common](http://us3.php.net/apc_store) [feature](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.wincache-ucache-add.php) [among](http://www.php.net/manual/en/memcache.add.php) most well-known libraries and extensions and was present in [ZF1 Zend_Cache](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/blob/master/library/Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php#L243). Sadly, zf2 is missing this.\n\n``` php\n// APC\napc_store ( string $key , mixed $var [, int $ttl = 0 ] );\n\n// Memcache\nMemcache::add( string $key , mixed $var [, int $flag [, int $expire ]] );\n\n// Wincache\nwincache_ucache_add ( string $key , mixed $value [, int $ttl = 0 ] );\n\n// Zend Server\nzend_shm_cache_store($internalKey, $value, $ttl);\n\n// Zend_Cache\nZend_Cache_Backend_File::save($data, $id, $tags = array(), $specificLifetime = false);\n\n// etc.\n```\n### Problem 1\n\nZF2 Cache Storage does not allow to store items with specific TTL.\n\nThe first problem was missing `$ttl` parameter in all [Cache\\StorageInterface](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Cache/Storage/StorageInterface.php#L99) write methods (i.e. `setItem()`, `replaceItem()` etc.). Without this, the only way to set an item with a specific TTL was:\n\n``` php\n/* @var $cache StorageInterface */\n$oldTtl = $cache->getOptions()->getTtl();\n$cache->getOptions()->setTtl(60); // set to 1 minute\n$cache->setItem('foo','bar'); // store the item\n$cache->getOptions()->setTtl($oldTtl); // restore previous ttl\n// *phew*\n```\n### Problem 2\n\nUnfortunately, the above code does not work properly. This is because many ZF2 adapters do not support or understand item-level TTL, unless it is handled internally by the backend (i.e. `apc_store()` natively supports TTL and it's getting fed with the one from options).\n\nFor example,  `Storage\\Memory` and `Storage\\Filesystem` would exhibit unexpected behavior when discarding old items or fetching items if we tried to manipulate ttl:\n\n``` php\n/* @var $cache StorageInterface */\n$cache = new \\Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\Memory();\n$cache->getOptions()->setTtl(3600); // set TTL to 1 hour\n$cache->setItem('foo',1); // store an item\n\n$cache->getOptions()->setTtl(60); // set TTL to 1 minute\n$cache->setItem('bar',1); // store another item\n\nsleep(61);\n\nvar_dump($cache->hasItem('bar'));  // false\nvar_dump($cache->hasItem('foo'));  // false\n// *poof*   \"foo\" item disappeared but should live for an hour\n```\n### The goal\n\n``` php\n/* @var $cache StorageInterface */\n$cache->setItem('foo','1', 60); // store the item for 60s\n$cache->setItem('bar','2', 3600); // store the item for 1 hour\n\n// store the item with default TTL setting from the storage\n$cache->setItem('bar','2'); \n\n// replace multiple items and set their TTL to 60s\n$cache->replaceItems(['foo'=>10,'bar'=>20], 60); \n\n// increment item by 5 and make it live for 1h\n$cache->incrementItem('foo', 5, 3600);\n```\n### Solution\n- [x] Add `$ttl` support to StorageInterface.\n- [x] Refactor `Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter` to handle $ttl in write operations.\n- [x] Pass on `$ttl` to listeners (plugins).\n- [x] Refactor all `Adapter\\*` classes to use per-item `$ttl` and pass it on to underlying backend.\n- [x] Refactor `Adapter\\Memory` to support per-item TTL.\n- [x] Refactor `Adapter\\Filesystem` to support per-item TTL.\n- [x] Add TTL tests that work with ad-hoc ttl setting.\n- [x] Add overlapping temporal per-item ttl tests.\n",

The current list of extensions that could be updated to a newer version only shows the new version number. \n\nThis feature was requested by wkone in Joomla forum http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=708&t=898474. I think that showing the current and new version gives an administrator more information about possible issues: If the extensions uses semantic versioning then 2.1 to 2.2 is a minor update with little issues. An update from 2.9 to 3.1 might give somewhat more issues.\n# Testing Instructions\n\nI had to test this feature on a Joomla 3.4.5 website because I was not able to use the \"Extension: Update\" funtion in Joomla 3.5Beta1. After installing some old versions of some extensions in 3.5Beta1 I did not get the list of updates for those extensions. Probably because those extensions do not have new versions for 3.5Beta1...\n\n**Edit:** Workaround to **test** this patch **on Joomla 3.5Beta1**: \nmanually **edit** libraries/cms/version/**version.php** and temporary change the constant for Release & Development level:\nconst RELEASE = '**3.4.5**';\nconst DEV_LEVEL = '**stable**';\nWith these values Joomla will find new extension updates for old 3rd party extensions.\n\nDon't forget to **change it back** to the original values **after testing** this patch. Original values:\nconst RELEASE = '3.5';\nconst DEV_LEVEL = '0-beta';\n## Before the PR\n\nI've installed 3 older versions of extensions that use Joomla's update functionality.\n**Extensions: Update** (via Extensions > Manage > Update) shows that there are 3 updates that can be installed. It shows the version of the extension that will be installed but not the current version\n\n![com_installer-update-current-version-before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1217850/11023815/39a0be4e-8683-11e5-8722-c8a2c029f1bb.png)\n## After the PR\n\nAfter installing this PR the **Extensions: Update** (via Extensions > Manage > Update) shows **Current version** and **Version** (that will be installed)\n\n![com_installer-update-current-version-after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1217850/11023816/39a0d0be-8683-11e5-9fba-affaa9984aae.png)\n",

There is no way to describe or filter for an individual topic.\n\nInstead, you have to page results back from a complete topic list, and unlike autoscaling groups (whose paging limit is something like 1600), the paging limit for SNS topics is 100. I didn't feel right not supporting result paging here; it's entirely possible a TF user could have more than 100 SNS topics if they really love the product, so I wrote a pager.\n\nThe file is `sns_topic_seeker.go` and implements a basic state machine whose design will look mighty familiar if you've ever seen [this presentation](http://cuddle.googlecode.com/hg/talk/lex.html#title-slide) by Rob Pike or read the source code to `text/template/parse/lex.go` in the stdlib. It's basically a slimmed down implementation of the same pattern, and I've covered it with a bunch of unit tests to make sure it works and works well.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think it could be abstracted to an interface and used to \"page\" anything in AWS that returns a `NextToken`, but I didn't want to build a generalized version if this is the only AWS resource that'll use it.\n\nAnyway, let me know if there are any problems here.

The background to this is as follows:\n1. A lot of Fabrik users want to make lists more compact - since there is no custom.css in the standard Joomla admin templates, at present we are using locale-based CSS i.e. en-gb.css (how weird is that!!!) to achieve this. Custom.css would be a more standard way of achieving this, and will be more convenient when developing a multi-country web-site where admin users might change locale frequently to test how it looks/works.\n2. Clearly a user can change the basic css files for the template, however that will be overwritten when you apply a Joomla update.\n3. It was previously suggested that the way to achieve this is to copy the template e.g. create my-isis and make changes to the CSS there. Copying an Admin template just to change small CSS seems to me to be a little over-kill - and will then provide a potential minefield of incompatibility where you are using a copy of an old template against an updated rest of Joomla, and a maintenance overhead to re-copy and reapply the css changes every time there is a joomla update.\n\nThis is a small and simple change with little risk, so I am not clear why there should be any issue with implementing it.\n",

The parser looks for it in the final segment, so it returns a 404 error, category not found.\n\nFix should be to change line 162 in the router as follows:\n\n```\nif (!$advanced && count($array))\n{\n    $array[count($array)-1] = (int) $catid . ':' . $array[count($array)-1];\n}\n```\n\nBasically change $array[0] to instead grab the last element. (This also makes more sense since it attaches the id to that actual category.)\n\nIf this can be confirmed as a bug, I'll submit the patch.\n### Testing Instructions\n\nAdd a link to a category on the homepage or a non-com_content menu item like the following: index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=XX. Have SEF Urls on so that the url is routed through JRoute.\n\nMake sure that the category is a second level category or lower.\n\nResulting url will be like 'component/content/category/16-events/past-events' which will not be routed correctly, because the id is not actually in the final segment.

See below for when using `choice_list`.\n#### As an array\n\n``` php\n$builder->add('choice', 'choice', null, array(\n    'choices' => array('a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', 'c' => 'C'),\n    'choices_attr' => array(\n        'a' => array('disabled' => true, 'data-foo' => 'bar'),\n        'c' => array('disabled' => true, 'data-foo' => 'bar'),\n    ),\n));\n```\n#### As a callable\n\n``` php\n$builder->add('choice', 'choice', null, array(\n    'choices' => array('a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', 'c' => 'C'),\n    'choices_attr' => function ($choice) {\n        $attributes = array();\n\n        if ('A' === $choice || 'C' === $choice) {\n            $attributes['disabled'] = true;\n            $attributes['data-foo'] = 'bar';\n        }\n\n        return $attributes;    \n    }\n));\n```\n### By passing the attributes to the choice lists\n\n``` php\n$builder->add('choice', 'choice', null, array(\n    'choice_list' => new SimpleChoiceList(\n        array('a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', 'c' => 'C'), array(), array(\n            'a' => array('disabled' => true, 'data-foo' => 'bar'),\n            'c' => array('disabled' => true, 'data-bar' => 'baz'),\n        )\n    )\n);\n```\n\nEdit : It is related to the following issues\n\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/7510\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/9694\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/3836\n",

It will be merged as soon as development for 2.7 officially starts.\n\nI implemented the additional options \"choice_label\", \"choice_name\", \"choice_value\", \"choice_attr\", \"group_by\" and \"flip_choices\" for ChoiceType. Additionally the \"preferred_choices\" option was updated to accept callables and property paths.\n\nThe \"flip_choices\" option will be removed in Symfony 3.0, where the \"choices\" will be flipped by default. The reason for that is that, right now, choices are limited to strings and integers (i.e. valid array keys). When we flip the array, we remove that limitation. Since choice labels are always strings, we can also always use them as array keys:\n\n``` php\n// Not possible currently, but possible with \"flip_choices\"\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n));\n```\n\nAll the features described here obviously also apply to subtypes of \"choice\", such as \"entity\".\n\n**choice_label**\n\nReturns the label for each choice. Can be a callable (which receives the choice as first and the key of the \"choices\" array as second argument) or a property path.\n\nIf `null`, the keys of the \"choices\" array are used as labels.\n\n``` php\n// callable\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'yes' => true,\n        'no' => false,\n        'maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_label' => function ($choice, $key) {\n        return 'form.choice.'.$key;\n    },\n));\n\n// property path\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        Status::getInstance(Status::YES),\n        Status::getInstance(Status::NO),\n        Status::getInstance(Status::MAYBE),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_label' => 'displayName',\n));\n```\n\n**choice_name**\n\nReturns the form name for each choice. That name is used as name of the checkbox/radio form for this choice. It is also used as index of the choice views in the template. Can be a callable (like for \"choice_label\") or a property path.\n\nThe generated names must be valid form names, i.e. contain alpha-numeric symbols, underscores, hyphens and colons only. They must start with an alpha-numeric symbol or an underscore.\n\nIf `null`, an incrementing integer is used as name.\n\n``` php\n// callable\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_name' => function ($choice, $key) {\n        // use the labels as names\n        return strtolower($key);\n    },\n));\n\n// property path\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => Status::getInstance(Status::YES),\n        'No' => Status::getInstance(Status::NO),\n        'Maybe' => Status::getInstance(Status::MAYBE),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_name' => 'value',\n));\n```\n\n**choice_value**\n\nReturns the string value for each choice. This value is displayed in the \"value\" attributes and submitted in the POST/PUT requests. Can be a callable (like for \"choice_label\") or a property path.\n\nIf `null`, an incrementing integer is used as value.\n\n``` php\n// callable\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_value' => function ($choice, $key) {\n        if (null === $choice) {\n            return 'null';\n        }\n\n        if (true === $choice) {\n            return 'true';\n        }\n\n        return 'false';\n    },\n));\n\n// property path\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => Status::getInstance(Status::YES),\n        'No' => Status::getInstance(Status::NO),\n        'Maybe' => Status::getInstance(Status::MAYBE),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'choice_value' => 'value',\n));\n```\n\n**choice_attr**\n\nReturns the additional HTML attributes for choices.

Can be an array/Traversable, a callable (like for \"choice_label\") or a property path.\n\nThe return values of the callable/property path are used as group labels. If `null` is returned, a choice is not grouped.\n\nIf `null`, the structure of the \"choices\" array is used to construct the groups.\n\n``` php\n// default\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Decided' => array(\n            'Yes' => true,\n            'No' => false,\n        ),\n        'Undecided' => array(\n            'Maybe' => null,\n        ),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n));\n\n// callable\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'group_by' => function ($choice, $key) {\n        if (null === $choice) {\n            return 'Undecided';\n        }\n\n        return 'Decided';\n    },\n));\n\n// property path\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => Status::getInstance(Status::YES),\n        'No' => Status::getInstance(Status::NO),\n        'Maybe' => Status::getInstance(Status::MAYBE),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'group_by' => 'type',\n));\n```\n\n**preferred_choices**\n\nReturns the preferred choices. Can be an array/Traversable, a callable (like for \"choice_label\") or a property path.\n\n``` php\n// array\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'preferred_choices' => array(true),\n));\n\n// callable\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => true,\n        'No' => false,\n        'Maybe' => null,\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'preferred_choices' => function ($choice, $key) {\n        return true === $choice;\n    },\n));\n\n// property path\n$builder->add('attending', 'choice', array(\n    'choices' => array(\n        'Yes' => Status::getInstance(Status::YES),\n        'No' => Status::getInstance(Status::NO),\n        'Maybe' => Status::getInstance(Status::MAYBE),\n    ),\n    'flip_choices' => true,\n    'preferred_choices' => 'preferred',\n));\n```\n\n**Technical Changes**\n\nTo properly implement all this, the old `ChoiceListInterface` class was deprecated and replaced by a new, slimmer one. The creation of choice views is now separated from choice lists. Hence a lot of logic is not executed anymore when processing (but not displaying) a form.\n\nInternally, a `ChoiceListFactoryInterface` implementation is used to construct choice lists and choice views. Two decorators exist for this class:\n- `CachingFactoryDecorator`: caches choice lists/views so that multiple fields displaying the same choices (e.g. in collection fields) use the same choice list/view\n- `PropertyAccessDecorator`: adds support for property paths to a factory\n\n**BC Breaks**\n\nThe option \"choice_list\" of ChoiceType now contains a `Symfony\\Component\\Form\\ChoiceList\\ChoiceListInterface` instance, which is a super-type of the deprecated `ChoiceListInterface`.\n\n**Todos**\n\nTo be completed after the release of 2.6:\n- [ ] Adapt CHANGELOGs\n- [ ] Adapt UPGRADE files\n- [ ] symfony/symfony-docs issue/PR\n",

'' : null;\n  });\n  $connexionResolver->setDefault('secure', false);\n  $connexionResolver->setNormalizer('secure', function (Options $connexion, $secure) {\n      return 443 === $nested['port'] ?: $secure;\n  });\n  $connexionResolver->setAllowedTypes('port', 'int');\n  $connexionResolver->setAllowedTypes('user', 'string');\n  \n  $resolver->setRequired('connexion');\n  $resolver->setNormalizer('connexion', function (Options $options, $resolvedConnexion) {\n      if ('localhost' === $resolvedConnexion['host']) {\n          $resolvedConnexion['host'] = $option['param'];\n      }\n  \n      return $resolvedConnexion;\n  });\n  \n  // In a sub class\n  parent::configureOptions($resolver);\n  \n  $resolver->setDefault('user', $user);\n  $connexionResolver = $resolver->setDefault(\n      'connexion', function (Options $options, $previousDefaultConnexion) {\n          if ($options['user'] instanceof UserInterface and 'localhost' !== $previousDefaultConnexion['host'])\n              $connexion['user'] = $options['user']->getUsername();\n          }\n  );\n  \n  $options = $resolver->resolve($array);\n  ```\n  \n  `*Allowed*` methods are not supported with root name of nested options since they always have to be an array, so:\n- f2ad947 trigger warning ? throw `BadMethodCallException` ? what do you think ?\n- 9e4e02a fixes #15524. Handle extra options resolving and `addAllowed*ForAll` rules with constant flags\n  - add `Options::NONE` constant,\n  - add `Options::ALL` constant, matches defined and extra options,\n  - add `Options::DEFINED` constant,\n  - add `Options::NESTED` constant,\n  - add `Options::EXTRA` constant, matches any undefined options, helps dealing with \"anonymous\" options (using a numerical index)\n  - add `OptionsResolver::allowedValuesForAll` a private array to validate all options even undefined but not root of nested options as they must always be an array,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::allowedTypesForAll` a private array to validate all options (as previous),\n  - add `OptionsResolver::resolveUndefined` a private `bool` to allow extra options resolving,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::addAllowedValuesForAll($options, $allowedValues, $replace = false, $nested = Options::ALL)`, first argument may be an array of options names or any flag constant except `Options::NONE`, if a root name of nested options is passed as/among first argument the method will be recursive because the fourth argument default is `Options::ALL`, prevent it by passing `Options::NONE` instead,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::addAllowedTypesForAll($options, $allowedTypes, $replace, $nested)`, same as previous, note that passing `Options::ALL` as first argument will not apply to root of nested options as they must always be arrays and on contrary will apply on extra options, pass `true` as third argument to override previous allowed types,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::setPrototypes((string|string[]) $types, (mixed) $values, $options = Options::EXTRA)`, sets `resolveUndefined` to `true` and validate any extra options with the any given type with its corresponding allowed values,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::allowExtraOptions($allow = true)`\n  \n  ``` php\n  $resolver->setNested('attachments', array($attachments))\n      ->allowExtraOptions()\n      ->addAllowedTypesForAll(Options::ALL, '\\Swift_Attachment');\n  \n  // Another way by implicitly allowing extra options:\n  $resolver->setNested('emails')\n      ->setPrototypes('string', function ($email) use ($regex) {\n          return preg_match($regex, $email);\n      });\n  ```\n  \n  The difference is that in the second case implicitly the flag `Options::EXTRA` is passed so previous defaults will not be validate by prototypes rules, if that's not what you want pass `Options::ALL` as third argument.\n  Note that `setNested()` returns the nested `OptionsResolver` instance in this examples, you could call these methods on the `$resolver` as well but this not the same:\n  \n  ``` php\n  // Any undefined global options can only be strings\n  $resolver\n      ->allowExtraOptions()\n      ->addAllowTypesForAll(Options::EXTRA, 'string', true, Options::NONE);\n  ```\n- ccd5ce1 Harden dependency of nested options with an internal class\n  - add `NestedOptions` class which extends `OptionsResolver`,\n  - add `NestedOptions::root` the parent `OptionsResolver` instance,\n  - add `NestedOptions::rootName` the root option name,\n  - add `NestedOptions::resolve()` overrides to throw an exception is parent `OptionsResolver` instance is not locked,\n  - add `OptionsResolver::isLocked()` internal public method to check from `NestedOptions` if it can be resolved.\n# Work in Progress (RFC)\n- add `OptionsResolver::setExtraNormalizer(function (Options $options, $extraName, $extraValue) { ... })` to normalize any undefined options, basically a shortcut for the currently supported `setNormalizer(Options::Extra, callable)` but with handling of `$extraName`\n- add a `OptionsResolver::prototypes` private array holding allowed values by allowed types to validate extra options.\n- be more strict on NestedOptions array type and indexing when setting defaults. Currently the implementation does not distinguish  nested defaults using a numerical index instead of names, which may cause problem when overriding them or to properly map validation/normalization.\n",

In order to do that, I had to split the external (exported and documented) version of `checkbounds` and the internal one, which used a different - undocumented - interface. I called `_checkbounds` the latter, but suggestions for better names are indeed welcome, even if it's just and internal function.\n\nUsing BitArrays as an example, here is a before/after:\n\nBefore:\n\n```\njulia-0.4> b = bitrand(3);\n\njulia-0.4> b[4] = true # does not call checkbounds\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 3-element BitArray{1}:\n  true\n  true\n false\n  at index [4]\n\njulia-0.4> b[4] = 1\nERROR: BoundsError\n in checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:78\n in checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:110\n in setindex! at multidimensional.jl:629\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```\njulia-0.4> b = bitrand(3);\n\njulia-0.4> b[4] = true # does not call checkbounds\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 3-element BitArray{1}:\n  true\n  true\n false\n  at index [4]\n\njulia-0.4> b[4] = 1\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 3-element BitArray{1}:\n  true\n  true\n false\n  at index [4]\n in _checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:78\n in checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:110\n in setindex! at multidimensional.jl:629\n```\n\nI tried to avoid extra allocations etc, but I'm submitting as a PR for review just to confirm that there should be no performance issues (cc @vtjnash which did the new BoundsError interface).\n\nOut of necessity, the reporting is also not particularly precise in more convoluted cases, e.g.:\n\n```\njulia-0.4> a = rand(2,3,2);\n\njulia-0.4> a[2,bitrand(4),2]\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2x3x2 Array{Float64,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 0.0514813   0.573538  0.150317\n 0.00485321  0.118724  0.435752\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 0.0525793  0.731588  0.813656\n 0.0234425  0.894198  0.977163\n  at index [2,Bool[true,true,false,false],2]\n in _checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:80\n in checkbounds at abstractarray.jl:108\n in getindex at multidimensional.jl:188\n```\n\nwhere the whole indexing expression is reported; it's still much better then before though.\n\nIf this is OK I'll proceed improving the error reporting in other areas as well (e.g. Strings).\n",

And the only methods that an AbstractArray subtype must define are `size` and just one `getindex` method:\n\n``` julia\ngetindex(::T, ::Int) # if linearindexing(T) == LinearFast()\ngetindex(::T, ::Int, ::Int, #=...ndims(A) indices...=#) if LinearSlow()\n```\n\nUnfortunately, it is currently impossible to express the latter method for arbitrary dimensionalities, but in practice it's not a big issue: most LinearSlow() arrays have a fixed dimension.\n\nThis is achieved through dispatch on an internal `_getindex` method, which recomputes the indices such that it can call the canonical `getindex` method that the user must define.  If the user has not defined their canonical method, it will fall back to an error method in `_getindex`.  I use similar scheme for `unsafe_getindex`, with the exception that we can fallback to the safe version if the subtype hasn't defined the canonical unsafe method.  This enables fast vector indexing by checking bounds of the index vectors instead of on each element.  And once `@inbounds` is extensible, AbstractArrays will be able to support it by default.\n\nThe difficulty with all this redirection is that an extra function call can wreck indexing performance, and it can be hard to avoid.  ~~I've had particular difficulty getting good performance with `CartesianIndexes`, and I still lag in performance there by 20x for big arrays.  I think call site inline annotations would be a magic bullet, but there may be other tricks we can use, too.  I've not looked into this very carefully yet, though.~~ (Fixed with a more sensible inlining strategy)\n\nTL/DR:\n\nIn my cursory performance tests [hacked onto Tim's indexing perf suite from his reshape work](https://gist.github.com/mbauman/39bb490ce2bee52417f1) (more tests are needed), I'm close to matching _or outperforming_ master with `Array` with only these definitions:\n\n``` julia\njulia> methods(getindex, (Array, Any...))\n3-element Array{Any,1}:\n getindex(A::Array{T,N},i::Int) at array.jl:304\n getindex{T<:Real}(A::Array{T,N},I::Range{T<:Real}) at array.jl:347 # Needed for bootstrap\n getindex(A::AbstractArray{T,N},I...) at abstractarray.jl:492\n```\n\n(Of course, in places where we're not quite able to close the gap we can always reinstate the specialized methods. This is just a very useful stress-test of both functionality and performance.)\n\ncc: @timholy \n",

The `Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\SimpleXMLElement` still exists, but it is no longer used, except to maintain BC. It does not appear to be used anywhere else in Symfony itself. Maybe some userland code uses it somewhere. If this is not part of the API it could be removed.\n2. The `parseFile` method still returns a SimpleXMLElement to maintain BC. I have added a new function `parseFileToDOM` that is used by the XmlFileLoader itself.

There was a previous PR (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/9431) which arbitrarily increased the timeout for AIX to 1 second, however this value is still a guess and appears to be insufficient. It's also worth noting the arbitrary timeouts have also caused problems for other platforms, see https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2891#issuecomment-179158473. Arbitrary timeouts cannot compensate for external factors such as system load.\n\nIn this PR I propose removing the timeout mechanism entirely, here is how the test currently works:\n1. Fork a master process from the test harness.\n2. The master uses cluster.fork to create a worker.\n3. The worker starts an HTTP server.\n4. The master will kill itself with process.exit.\n5. The worker will then also call process.exit as part of its [IPC pipe disconnect handler](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/8ebec086a50712bce675ae59c10ac30a4f01fa8d/lib/cluster.js#L547-L553). (*)\n6. The test harness will wait an arbitrary amount of time after the master's exit to check for the child's liveness, if it is still alive the test fails.\n\n(*) Without this mechanism the worker would become an orphan child of init.\n\nStep 6 is inherently flaky. The test was originally added as part of https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/commit/94d337eb0fbf78bda2af6938b4a65d3c94808caf#diff-0faa53fc02580d5de2ebb484c41d691cR498 where it specifically tested the new disconnect pathway.\n\nThe test boils down to the following actions:\n1. Cause the worker's disconnect handler to be run by calling exit(0) in the cluster master.\n2. Insure that the disconnect handler also exits the worker process.\n\nSince step 2 does not actually require step 1, I propose the following alternate flow:\n1. Fork a master process from the test harness.\n2. The master uses cluster.fork to create a worker.\n3. The worker starts an HTTP server.\n4. The master kills the IPC pipe (note this not the same as using the graceful cluster shutdown API in https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/2740/commits/6c383c61611fb78d0961a332c1ad55d1d5514ba6) which causes the child to disconnect itself. Ungracefully closing the IPC pipe causes the child to execute the same disconnect handler it executes when the master calls exit(0).\n5. The master waits for the child's exit event.\n6. The test harness checks for the child's liveness after the master's exit event.\n\nWith this setup there is no need for the arbitrary wait time. The obvious problem is if the child never exits the test will hang - however in that case the test will still be killed by the [test harness's global timeout](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/8ebec086a50712bce675ae59c10ac30a4f01fa8d/tools/test.py#L587-L591).\n\nI do believe a timeout mechanism is useful for detecting liveness issues, but the presence of arbitrary timeouts in the tests themselves should be minimized, the single timeout in the test harness suffices.\n\nAny comments are appreciated, especially from @AndreasMadsen.\n",

Then a Bootstrap Token with the \"signing\" usage can be used.\r\nBootstrap Tokens can also function as a way to allow short-lived authentication to the API Server\r\n(the token serves as a way for the API Server to trust the client), for example for doing the TLS Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Bootstrap Token more exactly?\r\n - It is a Secret in the kube-system namespace of type \"bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token\".\r\n - A Bootstrap Token must be of the form \"[a-z0-9]{6}.[a-z0-9]{16}\"; the former part is the public Token ID,\r\n   and the latter is the Token Secret, which must be kept private at all circumstances.\r\n - The name of the Secret must be named \"bootstrap-token-(token-id)\".\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Bootstrap Tokens in this proposal:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/bootstrap-discovery.md\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  kubeadm token [flags]\r\n  kubeadm token [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  create      Create bootstrap tokens on the server.\r\n  delete      Delete bootstrap tokens on the server.\r\n  generate    Generate and print a bootstrap token, but do not create it on the server.\r\n  list        List bootstrap tokens on the server.\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n      --kubeconfig string   The KubeConfig file to use for talking to the cluster (default \"/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf\")\r\n\r\nUse \"kubeadm token [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token list\r\nTOKEN                     TTL         EXPIRES   USAGES                   DESCRIPTION\r\n70c388.41a07b703aa4bedf   <forever>   <never>   authentication,signing   The default bootstrap token generated by 'kubeadm init'.\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token create\r\nc57e6a.abb75fa1debe555f\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token list\r\nTOKEN                     TTL         EXPIRES   USAGES                   DESCRIPTION\r\n70c388.41a07b703aa4bedf   <forever>   <never>   authentication,signing   The default bootstrap token generated by 'kubeadm init'.\r\nc57e6a.abb75fa1debe555f   <forever>   <never>   authentication,signing   <none>\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token create s\r\ntoken [\"s\"] was not of form [\"^([a-z0-9]{6})\\\\.([a-z0-9]{16})$\"]\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token create c57e6a.abb75fa1debe555f\r\na token with id \"c57e6a\" already exists\r\nlucas@THENINJA:~/luxas/kubernetes$ sudo ./kubeadm token delete c57e6a.abb75fa1debe555f\r\nbootstrap token with id \"c57e6a\" deleted\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Release note**:\r\n<!--  Steps to write your release note:\r\n1.

      "pr2.desc": "Currently, the `{{outlet}}` Handlebars helper always creates an \"OutletView\" (Metamorph extension of ContainerView) that manages the views rendered into the outlet.  While this handles simple view replacement on navigation (through connectOutlet class in routes, for example) it makes it difficult to animate between views since the outgoing view is immediately destroyed upon connecting the incoming view.\n\nThis change allows the view class used by the outlet to be set.  A simple use case is animating between views rendered into an outlet on a route change.  E.g. sliding (jQuery mobile-style) between master-detail views.  The pseudocode for a naive replacement outlet container view for this would be something like:\n\n``` handlebars\n{{outlet viewClass=App.SlideContainer}}\n```\n\n``` javascript\nApp.SlideContainer = Ember.ContainerView.extend({\n  _currentViewWillChange: Ember.beforeObserver(function() {\n    // Hold on to old view\n  }, 'currentView'),\n\n  _currentViewDidChange: Ember.observer(function() {\n    // Append new current view to container\n    // Slide all views in container to the left\n    // When animation is complete, destroy old view\n  }, 'currentView')\n});\n```\n\nPR #1034 addressed a similar issue but in @c0urg3tt3's case the problem could be easily solved by specifying `tagName` and other general view properties in the outlet helper call (since it's an extension of the view helper).  The problem being addressed here involves the need for custom view lifecycle handling code that requires replacing, not adding bindings to a hardcoded `OutletView` class.\n\nPR #1046 appears to be somewhat of a duplicate of #1034.  @wycats' [proposed solution](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/1046#issuecomment-6497862) does allow a custom class to be used but no longer is a sufficient replacement for the role of an outlet since the base view helper does not find and set the `outletSource` property of the parent view.\n",

Furthermore, there are many legitimate scenarios and use-cases where the need for request interception arises; for example\n- if security tokens, parameters or headers need to be calculated for each individual request\n- for collecting statistics like request counts, measuring turnaround times etc.\n- for dynamic, client-side redirects (e.g., rewrite /api/x to /api/experimental/x for resource x but not resource y)\n\nPlease see #929 for a further discussion (and use-cases) on this topic.\n## Implementation\n\nThe request interceptor registration works exactly like the registration of response interceptors (in fact, I have put this into a separate routine to make it more explicit). If request interceptors are present, they are prepended to the promise chain returned by $http \u2013 this was mostly devised and written by @splondike \u2013 this gives the interceptors a lot of flexibility and fits very well into the Angular API.\n## Tests and Documentation\n\nThis pull requests includes both tests and documentation of the new feature.\n\nA note on testing: a separate call to $rootScope.$apply is necessary to test the interceptors with the mocked http backend.\n## Example\n\n```\n// register interceptor using an anonymous function\n$httpProvider.requestInterceptors.push(function() {\n  return function(promise) {\n    return promise.then(function(config) {\n\n      // the config object will be used by the actual request\n      // you can modify it here\n\n      config.url = '/intercepted/' + config.url;\n\n      // return the config object to pass it on to the next interceptor\n      return config;\n\n      // if you reject the promise, the promise\n      // returned by $http will be rejected\n    };\n  };\n});\n```\n## Compatibility\n\nWhen no request interceptors are registered, no promises are prepended to the chain. Therefore, this feature should be completely backwards compatible \u2013 if you register not interceptors everything stays the same.\n",

Thanks for taking a look & weighing in! Whether you're for this change or against it, your feedback is valuable and I'll respond to it as soon as I'm able.\n## FAQ / TL;DR for newcomers\n#### **What is the current proposal?**\n\n_If_ landed, this will land **behind a flag**, moving out from behind the flag in the next major version as an unsupported API, finally becoming fully supported one major version after that. It **does not replace or supersede** the callback API, which will continue to be the canonical Node interface.\n\nPromise-returning variants will be exposed for all \"single-operation\" Node methods \u2014 that is to say, Streams and EventEmitter-based APIs are not included in this discussion.\n\nTo use promises:\n\n``` js\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile.promise(__filename).then(data => {\n})\n```\n\nUsing promises with destructuring assignment (where available):\n\n``` js\nconst {readFile} = require('fs').promise\n\nreadFile(__filename).then(data => {\n})\n```\n\nAs a prerequisite to this PR landing, domains must work as expected with native Promises (they currently do not.)

The conversation has mainly revolved around consensus, and the difficulty in attaining it when adding modules to the mix.\n- @ktrott does an [excellent job of summing up the concern](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5020#issuecomment-179452337).\n  - My [(again wordy, sorry!) response](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5020#issuecomment-179505468).\n\n---\n\n**This is the original text of the PR.** It does not reflect the current state of the conversation. See above for common themes!\nThis PR introduces Core support for Promises. Where possible, callbacks have\nbeen made optional; when omitted, a `Promise` is returned. For some APIs (like\n`http.get` and `crypto.randomBytes`) this approach is not feasible. In those\ncases promise-returning `*Async` versions have been added\n(`crypto.randomBytesAsync`). The naming there isn't set in stone, but it's\nbased on how [`bluebird`](http://bluebirdjs.com/)'s [`promisifyAll`](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.promisifyall.html)\nmethod generates names.\n\nThis PR allows users to swap the _implementation_ of promises used by core.\nThis helps in a few dimensions:\n- Folks that prefer a particular flavor of Promises for sugar methods can set\n  the promise implementation at app-level and forget about it.\n- This should alleviate concerns about stifling ecosystem creativity \u2014 putting\n  promises in Core doesn't mean Core needs to pick a winner.\n- Folks who prefer a faster implementation of promises can swap in their\n  preferred library; folks who want to use whatever native debugging is added\n  at the V8 level for native promises can avoid swapping in promises.\n- A world of benchmarks opens up for Promise library authors \u2014 any code in the\n  ecosystem that uses promises generated by core and has a benchmarking suite\n  is a potential benchmark for promise libraries.\n\nThe API for swapping implementations is `process.setPromiseImplementation()`.\nIt may be used many times, **however** after the first time deprecation warnings\nare logged with the origin of the _first_ call. This way if a package misbehaves\nand sets the implementation for an application, it's easy to track down.\n\nExample:\n\n``` js\nprocess.setPromiseImplementation(require('bluebird'));\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.readFile('/usr/share/dict/words', 'utf8')\n  .then(words => console.log(`there are ${words.split('\\n').length} words`))\n  .catch(err => console.error(`there are no words`));\n```\n\nStreams are notably missing from this PR \u2013 promisifying streams is more\ninvolved since the ecosystem already relies on a common (and more importantly,\noften **pinned**) definition of how that type works. Changing streams will take\neffort and attention from the @nodejs/streams WG. All other callback-exposing\nmodules and methods have been promisified (or an alternative made available),\nthough.\n\nThree new internal modules have been added:\n- `lib/internal/promises` \u2014 tracks the original builtin `Promise` object, as \n  well as the currently selected `Promise` implementation. All promises \n  created by Node are initially native, and then passed to the selected\n  implementation's `.resolve` function to cast them.\n- `lib/internal/promisify` \u2014 turn a callback-accepting function into one that\n  accepts callbacks _or_ generates promises. Errors thrown on the same tick\n  are still thrown, not returned as rejected promises \u2014 in other words,\n  programmer errors, such as invalid encodings, are still eagerly thrown.\n- `lib/internal/callbackify` \u2014 turn a synchronous or promise-returning function\n  into a callback-accepting function. This is only used in `lib/readline` for\n  the `completer` functionality. This could probably fall off this PR, but it\n  would be useful for subsequent changes to streams.\n## Breaking Changes\n- In general: any API that would have thrown with no callback most likely does\n  **not** throw now.\n- `fs` APIs called without a callback will no longer crash the process with an\n  exception.\n- `ChildProcess#send` with no callback no longer returns `Boolean`, instead\n  returns `Promise` that resolves when `.send` has completed.\n- Wrapped APIs:\n  - `child_process.ChildProcess#send`\n  - `cluster.disconnect`\n  - `dgram.Socket#bind`\n  - `dgram.Socket#close`\n  - `dgram.Socket#send`\n  - `dgram.Socket#sendto`\n  - `dns.lookupService`\n  - `dns.lookup`\n  - `dns.resolve`\n  - `fs.access`\n  - `fs.appendFile`\n  - `fs.chmod`\n  - `fs.chown`\n  - `fs.close`\n  - `fs.exists`\n  - `fs.fchmod`\n  - `fs.fchown`\n  - `fs.fdatasync`\n  - `fs.fstat`\n  - `fs.fsync`\n  - `fs.ftruncate`\n  - `fs.futimes`\n  - `fs.lchmod`\n  - `fs.lchown`\n  - `fs.link`\n  - `fs.lstat`\n  - `fs.mkdir`\n  - `fs.open`\n  - `fs.readFile`\n  - `fs.readdir`\n  - `fs.readlink`\n  - `fs.realpath`\n  - `fs.rename`\n  - `fs.rmdir`\n  - `fs.stat`\n  - `fs.symlink`\n  - `fs.unlink`\n  - `fs.utimes`\n  - `fs.writeFile`\n  - `net.Socket#setTimeout`\n  - `readline.Interface#question`\n  - `repl.REPLServer#complete`\n  - `zlib.deflateRaw`\n  - `zlib.deflate`\n  - `zlib.gunzip`\n  - `zlib.gzip`\n  - `zlib.inflateRaw`\n  - `zlib.inflate`\n  - `zlib.unzip`\n## New APIs\n- **`process.setPromiseImplementation`**\n- `net.connectAsync`\n- `tls.connectAsync`\n- `crypto.randomBytesAsync`\n- `crypto.pbkdf2Async`\n- `crypto.pseudoRandomBytesAsync`\n- `crypto.rngAsync`\n- `crypto.prngAsync`\n- `http.getAsync`\n- `https.getAsync`\n- `http.requestAsync`\n- `https.requestAsync`\n- `child_process.execAsync`\n- `child_process.execFileAsync`\n## Next steps\n\nI haven't finished this PR yet: the primary missing piece is tests for the\npromise-based APIs, to ensure that they resolve to the correct values. Docs\nalso need updated. I'll be working on this in my free time over the next week.\n\nHere are the bits that I'd like folks reading this to keep in mind:\n- The code changes here are fairly cheap, time-wise \u2014 one evening's worth of work.\n  - Technical possibility has never been the primary blocker.\n- We know async/await is coming down the pipe, and many devs are interested in\n  it.\n  - With ChakraCore potentially coming in, this may happen sooner than anyone\n    previously imagined.\n  - Even sans the ChakraCore PR, it's my understanding that V8 will be supporting\n    async/await by EOY (Correct me if I'm wrong, here!)\n- **Promises may not be your cup of tea.** This is okay. This is not an attempt to \n  **replace** callbacks or streams with promises. They can co-exist. While Promises \n  are complicated, much of that complication falls out of the problem space that \n  both callbacks and promises abstract over. Give this a fair shake.\n",

The jar is also available in Maven.\n\nAWS SDK for Java - Amazon S3:\n- Added support to return the part count of an object in object metadata. You can also download a part by setting part number in GetObjectRequest.\n- TransferManager supports parallel downloads for multipart objects.\n- Default to Signature Version 4 signing process in all regions.\n\nApache HttpClient upgraded to 4.5.2\n# Jackson update\n\nNote that [Jackson has been updated at some point](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/pom.xml#L115) but as we don't use dependency management anymore it has never been updated and we did not notice.\n\nSo I updated:\n- jackson-databind to 2.6.6.\n- jackson-annotations to 2.6.0.\n\nThat being said, I'm unsure if we should better use `${versions.jackson}` instead.\n# Functional changes\n\nFor `repository-s3` plugin, this new version of the AWS SDK now sets Throttle Retries (overridable by `use_throttle_retries`) to `true` by default instead of `false` previously.\n# Security manager issues\n\nTests are failing on `repository-s3` plugin with:\n\n```\n[2016-07-26 09:36:40,350][WARN ][repositories             ]

Enabling transitions without providing timeouts now logs a deprecation warning.\n\nThis solution isn't perfect, but in the absence of a more robust animation-event API, it's the best that can be done.

This works well for dealing with newline characters at the end of a certificate, however, this logic does not apply to the certificate _chain_. A change to the certificate chain is enough for Terraform to rebuild the resource. The combination of these two circumstances means that, if one has an IAM certificate with a chain in their Terraform configuration, `terraform plan` will _always_ require some action, even if everything appears to be in sync.\n\nThis pull request normalizes the certificate chain in the same way as the certificate body. While the major gains are in the use of `strings.TrimSpace`, the SHA hashing is nice to have, as well. In passing, the integration test for this resource has been updated to include a self-signed certificate bearing a CA chain.\n",

      "pr2.desc": "While our last major version bump (2.0) was a complete rewrite of the docs, CSS, and JavaScript, the move to 3.0 is equally ambitious, but for a different reason: **Bootstrap 3 will be mobile-first.** This is an ongoing document to identify the changes we'll be making along the way.\n## Docs and repo\n\nWe'll be working to simplify the content of the docs once again. Key changes are around the organization of the pages and the tools powering them.\n#### Repository\n- [x] **Add new `dist` folder.**\n  - Includes two subfolders, `css` and `js`, each containing a regular and minified version of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript.\n- [x] **Separate dependencies from compiled Bootstrap files** with new `assets` folder.\n  - All files within `assets` are documentation assets or third party dependencies.\n- [x] **Switch from Makefile to Grunt.**\n  - Grunt is JavaScript-based\n  - Helps folks who want to run and compile Bootstrap locally on Windows\n  - Replaces all existing `make` commands with `grunt` commands (all the same functionality, just a different tool)\n#### General docs changes\n- [x] **Convert docs to Jekyll.** \n  - Instead of Mustache, docs templates are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).\n  - This greatly simplifies deploying docs changes, isolates our docs from CSS and JavaScript changes, and drastically decreases the amount of code being tracked in the repo.\n  - It also provides better URLs, page title variables, partials, and code highlighting.\n  - New repo structure\n- [x] **Host previous versions of documentation.**\n  - Instead of having folks download release tags, we'll go back and add the docs for the most recent version (2.3.2) to the site. They'll be available at http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ once v3 goes live.\n- [x] **Move examples to separate repo.**\n  - Fitting with our theme of focus and simplicity in the repo, we're moving all the example templates out into their own repository at [twbs/bootstrap-examples](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-examples).\n  - This keeps the examples as static files without a Jekyll server in the way, so more folks have easy access to them.\n  - It also removes a ton of static files (the example screenshots) from the repo and that's a huge win.\n- [x] **Add \"Customizing Bootstrap\" section** to detail best practices for customizing CSS.\n- [x] **Remove all i18n tags from Mustache templates.** No more `{{_i}}` and `{{/i}}` in the docs templates, just raw HTML in our Mustache files.\n- [x] **Remove Extend page** because it's content was not directly applicable to Bootstrap and out of date with info in the readme and Getting Started page.\n#### Homepage\n- [x] Point link to the new [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com).\n- [x] Remove examples and basically all marketing content from homepage.\n#### Getting started\n- [x] Add Bower installation instructions to guide.\n- [x] Add new Customization best practices section.\n## Global JavaScript\n- [x] Overhaul CSS transitions and reinforce with JavaScript transitions as necessary.\n- [x] Improve noConflict throughout plugins.\n- [x] Namespace events to reduce conflict issues.\n- [x] **Drop bootstrap-typeahead.js.**\n  - For context, see #7805 & https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/88dd9de9bad56b30a12466477a810c78648200c9.\n  - Instead, use [Twitter's typeahead.js plugin](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/).\n## Global CSS\n\nAt a high level, we're dropping IE7 and FF3.6 support, combining standard and responsive CSS into a single file, and consolidating additional code as appropriate.\n### Browser support\n- [x] **Drop support for IE7.** Removed all `*` hacks, such as `*zoom: 1;`, and other IE7-specific lines of CSS.\n- [x] **Drop support for Firefox 3.6.** Removed `-moz-box-shadow` instances and related hacks.\n### LESS changes\n- [x] **Refactor most components to be more mixin-friendly.**\n  - Instead of all component classes being a hodgepodge of un-nested CSS, we'll re-order the code to make it super easy to take any Bootstrap class and use it as a mixin.\n  - Not all components have been rewritten this way, but those that make sense to rename have.\n- [x] **Rename variables to use dashes** instead of camelCase. For example, it's now `@body-bg` instead of `@bodyBackground`.\n- [x] **More consistent variable naming scheme.**\n  - The format of variables was all over the place and has now been standardized.\n  - The general approach is element, state, pseudo state. For example, `@navbar-link-color-hover`.\n- [x] **Replace existing color variables with more semantic ones.**\n  - No more `@blue`, `@orange`, and the like, which we weren't using them much anyway.\n  - They've been replaced with `@brand-primary`, `@brand-success`, and others. These are then assigned on a per-component basis (e.g., `@state-warning-text`, `@btn-background-primary`, etc).\n  - Also removed `@black` and `@white` because `#000` and `#fff` are 20% shorter and not something that should be controlled via variable.\n- [x] **Remove `.border-radius()` and `.border-*-*-radius` mixins.** \n  - As only Android 2.1, iOS 3.2, and older desktop browsers [require a prefixed version](http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius), we've removed the base mixin. Since we no longer require prefixes for independent corners, we've dropped those mixins as well. Mixins for a single side, like `.border-left-radius`, are still available.\n- [x] **Use decimal values in `.opacity()` mixin instead of whole numbers** to match default CSS patterns. \n  - For example, write `.opacity(.5)` instead of `.opacity(50)`.\n- [x] **Add retina image mixin.** Declare a standard and 2x image path and set the size for easy retina images anywhere with `.img-retina()`.\n- [x] **Add new global `@component-active-bg` variable.**\n  - Instead of assigning `@link-color` to multiple variables for backgrounds, we have dedicated a new variable to that.\n  - Change `@component-active-bg` and customize the active states of nav pills, dropdowns, and more.\n- [x] **Update gradient mixins for better color stop support.**\n  - Vertical and horizontal gradients now accept four values, in the following order: `@start-color`, `@start-percent`, `@end-color`, and `@end-percent`.\n  - Upgrading means specifying all four values in the above order, or specifying variables directly when calling your mixins.\n  - To call a gradient but only set two properties, directly assign values to the variables like so: `#gradient > .vertical(@start-color: red; @end-color: blue);`. Doing so will include the default values for any unmentioned variables.\n- [x] **Drop unused prefixes from several mixins.**\n  - See https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/8380 for more information.\n### Miscellaneous\n- [x] **Go mobile first.** Responsive CSS is no longer separate and all responsive features are now compiled into the core `bootstrap.css` file near. Separate files are no longer required, and have thus been removed.\n- [x] **Upgrade to latest Normalize, and removed reset.less.** \n  - This includes removing reset.less in favor of a dedicated normalize.less file. \n  - Print styles and responsive image CSS (the only meaningful modifications from the previous reset file) have been moved to print.less and scaffolding.less, respectfully.\n- [x] **Moved print styles to separate print.less file.**\n  - Previously print styles were bundled with the scaffolding.less page.\n  - Now within a separate file for easy removal via the Customizer.\n- [x] **Remove layouts.less.** \n  - Since it only held a couple layout styles and the fluid container has been removed (see next section), this file is superfluous. \n  - We've moved the default `.container` styles to `grid.less`.\n- [x] **Add `!important` to `.hide` and `.show`.** \n  - For these classes to work on every element, the specificity either needed to be higher or we needed the `!important` flag. We opted for the latter for fewer lines of code.\n- [x] **Drop `*-important` for `.*-danger`.** \n  - Some elements had red variations that came from different class naming schemes, so we standardized that by switching all red variations to `*-danger`. \n  - Includes buttons, labels, badges, text, alerts. and progress bars.\n- [x] Refactor responsive utility classes to match new media queries.\n## Grid system\n\nThe grid is drastically simpler, yet more powerful, in BS3. We're transitions back to a single grid system, but with all the awesomeness that was present in the old grids. On top of that, we've also added some new features.\n- [x] **Overhaul grid systems to make it fluid and mobile-first.**\n  - Removed the separate fluid grid system, container, and layout as we're down to one grid.\n  - New single grid system (still uses `.row`) utilizes percentages over pixels, `padding` instead of `margin`, and `box-sizing: border-box` for easy math.\n  - The grid is mobile first, meaning it starts out stacked and scales up as necessary to become horizontal via media queries. Previously the grid was built for 940px layouts and scaled up and down.\n  - Nesting is still 100% supported, but columns will be proportionately sized to their parent, just as the old fluid grid behaved.\n  - Offsets are still 100% supported.\n- [x] **Increase specificity of grid classes.**\n  - Instead of `.span*` and `.offset*`, we're now using `.col-*` and `.col-offset-*`, respectively.\n- [x] **Add tiny and small grid systems for phones and tablets.**\n  - Similar to the default grid system, we've added two more sets of grid classes to create more complex layouts for phones and tablets. That means you can optionally utilize 12 columns at two additional important breakpoints.\n  - Use `.col-*` classes for tiny devices (smartphones).\n  - Use `.col-sm-*` classes for small devices (tablets).\n  - The small grid classes also include support for offsets and source ordering, but the tiny grid classes do not.\n- [x] **Simplify required grid variables.**\n  - The `@grid-row-width` and `@grid-column-width` variables have been removed. We didn't use the row width (`@gridRowWidth` as of v2.3.1) variable anywhere in the source and column widths are now derived via simple calculations in our LESS.\n  - We've added a new `@grid-float-breakpoint` variable to customize the point at which the floats and widths kick in for our new mobile-first grid.\n- [x] **New and improved grid mixins.**\n  - Changed `.makeRow()` to `.make-row()`.\n  - Changed `.makeColumn()` to `.make-column()`. In addition, it includes a media query to apply the `float` and `width` when above the `@grid-float-breakpoint` value.\n  - Added `.make-column-offset()` to generate column gaps, similar to the predefined grid classes.\n- [x] **Add `.col-push-*` and `.col-pull-*` modifier classes** for easy column source ordering.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated table grid classes.**\n  - They are no longer necessary given the new grid.\n  - However, we are still removing the float on `.col-*` classes when used within `.table` elements.\n- [x] **Remove dedicated input grid classes.**\n  - Remove input grid mixin and input span classes.\n  - Given new grid system, inputs are always `width: 100%;` to start.\n  - Best practices now are to place 100% wide inputs _within_ grid columns as opposed to using classes directly on input elements.\n- [x] Use `max-width` instead of `width` on all `.container` instances to help prevent some issues with containers in components like navbars.\n## Type\n\nTypography in Bootstrap 3 isn't seeing much change, just a decent amount of cleanup and some small improvements.\n#### Headings\n- [x] Add support for headings classes (e.g., `h1, .h1 { \u2026 }`).\n- [x] Remove `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` from headings to prevent (inconsistent) broken rendering on some Android and Windows devices.\n#### Lists\n- [x] Change `ul.unstyled` to `.list-unstyled`.\n  - No longer dependent on HTML element in the selector.\n  - Can now be used as mixin.\n- [x] Change `ul.inline` to `.list-inline`.\n  - Uses `.list-unstyled` as a mixin to reset default list styles.\n  - Can now be used as a mixin.\n#### Text classes\n- [x] **Changed `.muted` to `.text-muted`** to match the other contextual text colors.\n- [x] Fixed bug with text alignment utility classes and tables.\n#### LESS\n- [x] Remove all `#font` mixins.\n  - We only used these in one place and they honestly just complicated things.\n  - Instead of using mixins, just make use of the `@font-family-` variables.\n- [x] Drop the `@altFontFamily` variable.\n\nWe explored the use of rem units over pixels, but found little benefit to offset the implications of their use. IE8 would still need a pixel fallback, and that's a lot of duplicate lines of code. Moreover, using rems everywhere instead of pixels would exacerbate that problem. Mixing rems and pixels doesn't seem to make sense either right now. However, we can and will continue to evaluate this in future releases.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add support for responsive utility classes on table elements.**\n- [x] Remove `table.info` from table state classes.\n- [x] Added global `text-align: left;` for `<th>` elements (to undo the default center alignment) and removed `font-weight: bold;` from them (bold is a browser default).\n- [x] Improve nesting by scoping all styles to immediate children.\n  - Using the `>` selector, we scope all styles.\n  - Doesn't change much, but does mean you'll need to apply the table classes to all nested tables.\n## Images\n- [x] **Consolidate image thumbnail styles.** No more `.img-polaroid` as it duplicated the same styles as `.thumbnail`. Now you can use `.img-thumbnail` for regular inline(-block) images, or `.thumbnail` for composite components.\n## Buttons\n\nFewer, but better buttons. They're redesigned and we're removing some from the mix because they have no clear and universal semantic purpose.\n- [x] **Default button now requires `.btn-default` class.**\n  - The default gray button requires two classes\u2014`class=\"btn btn-default\"`.\n  - This better matches all our other buttons as well.\n  - We tried to remove the `.btn` class as well, but given the CSS for creating button groups and dropdowns, it's much simpler to keep it around.\n  - While it does add an extra class, it's specificity great simplifies customization methods in plain CSS, and even more so when extending those classes with LESS mixins.\n- [x] **Drop `.btn-inverse`.**\n  - There _really_ is no semantic reasoning for having it, so it's gone.\n- [x] Revamp some of the aesthetics of the buttons (no more outer box-shadow) by default.\n- [x] **Simplify button mixins and pseudo states.**\n  - Removed the `.buttonBackground()` mixin since it was no longer in use.\n  - Added the `.btn-pseudo-states()` mixin for setting button `background-color` and `border-color` for the default and `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and various `disabled` states.\n- [x] **Add justified button group option for link buttons.**\n  - This feature is only available for buttons with link tags, e.g. `<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn\">Button</a>`, and is not compatible with the `<button>` element due to some browser lame-itude that keeps buttons from accepting auto widths on `table-cell` buttons.\n## Tables\n- [x] **Add `.active` contextual class.**\n  - Applies the table hover `background-color` to any row or cell that gets the `.active` class.\n- [x] Allow contextual classes to be applied to `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` cells.\n## Forms\n\nForm controls are now 100% width by default, input groups have been overhauled, and form states simplified.\n- [x] **Update box model for inputs.** \n  - Switched to `box-sizing: border-box;` and `width: 100%;` by default for all textual inputs.\n  - This means you'll need to specify a size for inputs, whereas before 3.0 inputs had a set pixel width (around 220px) to start.\n- [x] **Remove `input-prepend` and `input-append` for singular `.input-group`.** The classes have changed for the elements within, and require a bit more markup to use buttons.\n  - Use `.input-group` as the parent class around the input and addon.\n  - For text based prepends/appends, use `.input-group-addon`  instead of `.addon`.\n  - For button prepends/appends, use `.input-group-btn` and place your `.btn` **within** that element.\n- [x] **Drop `.form-search`.**\n- [x] **Add support for `fieldset[disabled]`.** All form controls within a `<fieldset>` with the `disabled` attribute will be styled appropriately.\n- [x] **Drop `cursor: pointer;` from labels** and instead only set them on checkbox and radio label options.\n- [x] **Drop `.controls-row` for grid inputs.** \n  - Given input elements in 3.0 are set to `width: 100%` by default, and since we don't want to implement a separate input grid, we've opted to drop the `.controls-row` functionality.\n  - Instead, folks should wrap inputs in standard grid markup: with a wrapping `.row` and individual `.span*` columns around each input.\n- [x] **Drop `.input-block-level` mixin and class.** \n  - Since inputs are already `width: 100%;`, this is redundant. \n  - **Note:** inputs are still `display: inline-block`, so if you absolutely need them to be block level, you'll need to independently set that yourself.\n- [x] **Drop the `.uneditable-input` control.** Instead, use a read-only input if you must.\n- [x] **Drop `.inline-help` option.**\n- [x] **Horizontal forms are now mobile-first**, meaning at <768px, elements are stacked. Above that, elements are floated and appear side-by-side.\n- [x] **Checkboxes and radios now require an extra `<div>`.** \n  - Instead of `label.checkbox`, you'll need `div.checkbox` with a `<label>` within. \n  - This was done to tighten up the clickable area around labels and avoid potential misclicks.\n- [x] **New classes for inline radios and checkboxes.** \n  - Instead of `.radio.inline`, you now need a single class, `.radio-inline`, for direct use on a `<label>` element. \n  - To be clear, inline radios and checkboxes do not need a wrapping `<div>`, but the default stacked ones do.\n- [x] Added new placeholder syntax to the `.placeholder()` mixin for Firefox 19+.\n- [x] **Drop `.help-inline`.**\n  - Given the 100% wide inputs and focus on mobile, inline help text makes much less sense.\n  - Block help text via `.help-block` remains.\n## Icons\n- [x] **Convert to Glyphicons font and move to separate repository.**\n  - Convert to Glyphicons v1.7 @font-face and drop the old PNGs.\n- [x] **Change required base class and prefix.** \n  - Instead of using an attribute selector, like `[class^=\"glyphicon-\"]`, we now require a base class, `.glyphicon`.\n  - This improves general performance for larger pages while also increasing the durability of our code (as it doesn't enforce a specific order of classes). \n  - This is in addition to the prefix class (which has also been udpated).\n  - All classes start with `.glyphicon-` instead of `.icon-` for a more unique class and consistency with the newly required base class.\n## Responsive utilities\n- [x] Refactor responsive-utilities.less to use new mobile-first approach.\n- [x] Update the docs to reflect the changes in media queries used.\n## Button groups\n- [x] **Add support for dropdowns in button groups (or, nested button groups).**\n- [x] **Update checkbox and radio variations to use form controls.**\n  - Checkbox and radio button groups now use `<input>`s in their markup.\n## Labels and badges\n\nWe have differentiated the labels and badges with v3. The gist is that badges no longer have modifier classes and are purely meant as unread counters.\n- [x] Dropped all modifier variations on badges, making it as neutral as possible, much like those of Mail.app on OS X.\n- [x] Dropped the `.label-inverse` variation (in conjunction with the inverse button being removed).\n- [x] Refactor labels to scale with their parent's `font-size`.\n## Jumbotron (formly hero unit)\n- [x] **Class changed** from `.hero-unit` to `.jumbotron`. Associated variables have also been updated to match.\n- [x] **Lighter `font-weight` for headings**. Uses semibold instead of bold for headings.\n- [x] **Scale `font-size`** in responsive views.\n- [x] Now full-width without rounded corners to in mobile viewports.\n- [x] Improved type styles\u2014now it starts with normal heading sizes and scales to larger sizes given a larger viewport.\n## Breadcrumbs\n- [x] Remove the trailing `/` from the last item.\n## Navigation\n#### Navs\n- [x] **Remove `.nav-list` option**. Replaced by the new `.list-group` component.\n- [x] **Remove tabs on left, right, and bottom.** \n  - Tabs on the left and right, while occasionally useful, have been removed from our CSS.\n  - You can still use the JavaScript plugin and custom CSS to make left/right tabs, but we will no longer include those in the core.\n- [x] **Removed parent `<div>` in the pagination component** and **dropped center and right alignment options**. See #6562 for context.\n#### Navbars\n- [x] **Drop support for `.navbar-search`.** We dropped the `.navbar-search` form layout, so it doesn't make sense to have this anymore. Also, this is just a _slightly_ fancier `.navbar-form`, which we plan on keeping.\n- [x] **Overhaul styles of default navbar** and its sub-components:\n  - Dropdown menu carets (those attached to the actual menu, not the indicators) have been removed so that dropdown menus sit flat against the edge of the navbar.\n  - Navbar vertical dividers have been brought in a smidge, meaning they do not extend the full height of the navbar.\n  - No more box-shadow or gradients on the navbars.\n  - Height of navbar has increased from 44px to 62px for mobile devices, and 50px for desktops.\n- [x] **Removed `.navbar-inner`** and moved relevant styles to `.navbar`. The inner div is no longer required, greatly simplifying our shit.\n- [x] **Changed `.navbar > .nav` to `.navbar-nav`.**\n- [x] **Change `.btn-navbar` to `.navbar-toggle`.**\n  - More consistent naming schema\n  - Redesigned it a bit, lightening the styles and widening it, while also positioning it absolutely to the top right.\n- [x] **Updated navbar brand component:**\n  - Changed `.brand` to `.navbar-brand` for a more consistent naming schema.\n  - Center aligned `.navbar-brand` in mobile views, with a `max-width: 200px;` to limit hit area given a likely navbar toggle will be very near by.\n- [x] **Dropped navbar dividers.**\n- [x] **Added support for disabled nav links.**\n  - Includes new variables like `@navbar-link-color-disabled` and `@navbar-link-bg-disabled`, along with the inverse options.\n#### Dropdowns\n- [x] **Remove submenus** suport in dropdown menus.\n- [x] Removed `.nav-header` and replaced with `.dropdown-header` on account of no more `.nav-list` and that dropdowns still benefit from section headings.\n## Progress bars\n- [x] **Add variables for background colors.** Instead of hard-coded (and different) green, red, yellow, and blue colors, we use the new (more semantic) global colors.\n- [x] **Refactor progress bar classes** for simpler CSS.\n  - New structure is now `.progress` on the outer `<div>` and `.progress-bar` on the inner `<div>`.\n  - Instead of placing modifier classes on the parent, they are placed directly on the bars (e.g., `.progress-bar-info`) in addition to the required `.progress-bar` class.\n## Modals\n- [x] **No longer require use of `.hide`.** We updated the utility classes to use `!important` and to avoid clashing, removed the `.hide` class from modals. Now `display: none;` is set directly in the modals.less file. **When upgrading, be sure to remove the `.hide` class from existing modals.**\n- [x] **Redesign the modals to be mobile-first.**\n  - As BS3 is mobile-first, this new modal also starts at the mobile level and scales up via media queries.\n  - Reintroduces `.modal-open` on the body (so we can nuke the scroll there)\n  - Adds a couple extra levels of markup (namely `.modal-dialog` and `.modal-content`) so we can scroll the entire modal rather than overflow a section within the modal.\n  - Related, `.modal` is now the wrapper, and `.modal-content` is the modal itself. This is so we can still use `position: fixed;`, but make the modal relatively positioned so that scrolling moves the entire modal, not something with it.\n  - Added a `.modal-title` for more consistent and useful targeting of the heading content (previously this was just an `<h3>` and selector performance wise that sucked).\n- [ ] **Test on iOS5.** Not sure if we need to go older, but I want to check here to see how well fixed is supported.\n- [ ] **Test on Android devices** (including native browser and Chrome). I only have a year-old Nexus lying around, so might need help tracking down bugs on older devices.\n- [ ] **Add option to programmatically set width** of the modal.\n- [ ] Prevent `<body>` scrollbar and shifting content with `overflow: hidden;`.\n## Thumbnails\n- [x] **Drop the `.thumbnails` meta component.** Instead of special HTML and CSS for grid sizing, just use the grid system itself. Individual `.thumbnail` styles are still available, but for sizing, require a parent with a set `width` (e.g., grid columns).\n## Alerts\n- [x] `<hr>` elements within any `.alert` component will now be styled to match the border color of the alert.\n- [x] Immediate children links within default alerts, and within paragraph text, are now styled for improved readability. Links are automatically bolded and appear as a slightly darker color than the alert text.\n## New: List groups\n\nAdded a new component, the list group, for creating simple and complex series of components. Perfect for more complex implementations like email inboxes, or simple ones like a list of options.\n- Requires `.list-group` as a parent base class (on a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<div>`)\n- Requires  `.list-group-item` for individual list items\n- List items can also be easily linked\u2014just change from `<ul class=\"list-group\">` and `<li class=\"list-group-item\">` to `<div class=\"list-group\">` and `<a class=\"list-group-item\">`.\n- Option: include a badge, chevron, or both to any list item for automatic placement.\n- Option: use `.list-group-item-heading` and `.list-group-item-text` for custom content implementations.\n\n**Linked list groups replace the nav list component.**\n\nList groups can also be used within panels with the `.list-group-flush` class to take them the full width of the parent panel.\n## New: Panels\n\nAdded a new component, the panel, for easily containing content within a box with an optional heading. Also included are contextual state classes for success, warning, danger, and info.\n## Tooltips\n- [x] Bump font-size from 11px to 12px.\n## Carousel\n- [x] **Redesign!** Lighter styles for the previous and next controls, as well as the carousel captions.\n- [x] **Update required markup for carousel controls.** The `.carousel-control` class now requires another element within it for the previous/next characters. Those characters are now Glyhpicons icons for improved styling and positioning across browsers and devices.\n- [x] **Indicators are now bottom-middle aligned.**\n- [x] **Captions are reinforced as optional** and, by default, are hidden on mobile views, then shown for >768px viewports.\n## Customizer\n- [x] Redesign the entire thing.\n- [ ] Highlight dependencies between components and assets.\n- [ ] Figure out how to load and download the same customizations.\n",

I'd argue that, with some recent trends in application development, it might now be worthwhile to revisit the issue.\n\nNamely, at the moment, an API update (PATCH/PUT request) yields :no_content. This is technically a correct approach according to Roy Fielding's HTTP Protocols (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) and as pointed out by Steve Klabnik thusly in March 2013:\n\n\"If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.\"\n\nAt the moment, we see a 204 response in Rails. Again, technically correct. However, the past year and a half have heralded a rise in the use of a SOA approach to software engineering, especially in the Rails application community. Given the increase in the sheer number of APIs, the time spent editing APIs, and the instances of updates made through APIs that accompany this trend, we want to make it as convenient as possible in Rails for folks to develop, use, and read APIs\u2014including checking their work. By changing the api_behavior method to show the updated data (200 request) after data is updated through an API, rather than a no_content (204 request), we save API users the step of manually checking the updated data in their rails console or database editor to make sure it's correct. This way, one doesn't need to use a .jbuilder view, other view, or series of code lines in their API to display updated data: the default respond_with command will just do it for them.\n\nA note: I had the added line respond to both PATCH and PUT, just in case, but I can also imagine why you might want it to just be PATCH at this point. \n",

I really don't see a way around this.  Consider the following:\n\n``` html\n<!-- Inside a container, row -->\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-sm-4\">\n    Some Text\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-sm-4 col-push-2\">\n    Some More Text\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-2 col-sm-4 col-pull-5\">\n    Corporate Logo\n</div>\n```\n\n(also available as a [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/52VtD/5/))\n\nThis is going on the traditional \"info bar\" at the bottom of every page, look at the bottom of any modern web page to see what I'm talking about.  On tablet and large screens, I want the corporate logo to be centered.  On the tablet, the logo can be a little bigger, because I'm going to hide some of the text in the info boxes.\n\nHowever, there is currently no way whatsoever to specify that the pushing and pulling is different on the small grid.  If the small grid is set to the same as the large grid (col-lg-5, col-sm-5, col-push-2) of course it works just fine.  But if the grid changes for tablets, then push, pull, and offset all break miserably.\n\nWith this patch, you can change the above code to:\n\n``` html\n<!-- Inside a container, row -->\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-sm-4\">\n    Some Text\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-5 col-push-2 col-sm-4 col-sm-push-4\">\n    Some More Text\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-2 col-pull-5 col-sm-4 col-sm-pull-4\">\n    Corporate Logo\n</div>\n```\n\nClasses get a bit cluttered, but honestly I see no other way to do this.\n",

The\nparent linking function then does:\n1. execute its pre-link functions\n2. call the child elements linking function (traverse)\n3. execute its post-link functions\n\nNow, we have two linking functions for the same DOM element level (because the templateUrl directive\nhas been split).\n\nThere has been multiple issues because of the order of these two linking functions (creating\ncontroller before setting up scope locals, running linking functions before instantiating\ncontroller, etc.). It is easy to fix one use case, but it breaks some other use case. It is hard to\ndecide what is the \"correct\" order of these two linking functions as they are essentially on the\nsame level.\n\nRunning them side-by-side screws up pre/post linking functions for the high priority directives\n(those executed before the templateUrl directive). It runs post-linking functions before traversing:\n\n``` js\nbeforeTemplateNodeLinkFn(null); // do not travers\nafterTemplateNodeLinkFn(afterTemplateChildLinkFn);\n```\n\nComposing them (in any order) screws up the order of post-linking functions. We could fix this by\nhaving post-linking functions to execute in reverse order (from the lowest priority to the highest)\nwhich might actually make a sense.\n\n**My solution is to remove this splitting.** This commit removes the `beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn`. The\nfirst run (before we have the template) only schedules fetching the template. The rest (creating\nscope locals, instantiating a controller, linking functions, etc) is done when processing the\ndirective again (in the context of the already fetched template; this is the cloned\n`derivedSyncDirective`).\n\nWe still need to pass-through the linking functions of the higher priority directives (those\nexecuted before the templateUrl directive), that's why I added `preLinkFns` and `postLinkFns`\narguments to `applyDirectivesToNode`.\n\nThis also changes the \"$compile transclude should make the result of a transclusion available to the\nparent directive in post- linking phase (templateUrl)\" unit test. It was testing that a parent\ndirective can see the content of transclusion in its pre-link function. That is IMHO wrong (as the\n`ngTransclude` directive inserts the translusion in its linking function). This test was only passing because of\nc173ca412878d537b18df01f39e400ea48a4b398, which changed the behavior of the compiler to traverse\nbefore executing the parent linking function. That was wrong and also caused the #3792 issue, which\nthis change fixes.\n\nCloses #3792\n",

Will work on it.\n\nI'm excited to see yours review comments! :+1: \n\n**Note:** This should be cherry-pick on 3.0. Could be very useful to have it on 2.7 also because of new LTS. It's up to you.\n",

Therefore I added a new _host requirement to the routing system. This makes it possible to work with several host names in one symfony installation. It can be easily added to any route like\n\n```\n _welcome:\n   pattern: /\n   requirements: { _host: 'example.org' }\n```\n\nIt is quite useful when you define routes as annotations, because you can set a host for a whole controller:\n\n```\n/**\n* @Route(requirements={\"_host\"=\"example.org\"})\n*/\nclass MyController { ... }\n```\n\nI also added an UrlGenerator so it is possible to generate urls just like before. The only difference is that an absolute URL will be generated if the current request has not the same host name.\n\nMaybe it could be a bit more flexible to define host routes, but it is a first attempt.

I changed the logic to be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. lc_check will replace instances if the lc name is different\r\n2. replace_instances w/ lc_check will replace all passed instances that are in the asg with the wrong lc name.\r\n3. replace_instances w/o lc_check will replace all passed instances within the asg (even if they have the same lc name).\r\n\r\nThis seemed to follow what the documentation stated.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE!!!!! This is still a work in progress, I just wanted to get some feedback before polishing out the errors.  Right now I think I have some errors by not sleeping for 10 second, due to aws change, and quick repulling will not reflect the change.

This would be possible by using a slightly more comlicated query for determining the valid opclasses:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT am.amname AS index_method,\n       opc.opcname AS opclass_name\n    FROM pg_am am, pg_opclass opc\n    WHERE opc.opcmethod = am.oid\n    ORDER BY index_method, opclass_name;\n```\n\nThe code is very loosely based on a previous implementation in the postgres_ext 1.0 gem which provided an index_opclass option when working with Rails 3.2.x.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n\n``` ruby\nadd_index :people, :last_name, opclass: :varchar_pattern_ops\nadd_index :people, :last_name, using: :gist, opclass: :gist_trgm_ops\n```\n\n[Relevant Postgres Docs: Operator Classes and Operator Families](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/indexes-opclass.html)\n",

      "pr2.desc": "### Summary\n\nAfter updating ActiveRecord version from 4.1 in my application I noticed a strange behavior. If I call `#valid?` method for an ActiveRecord model, it may raise an unexpected `RangeError` exception. For example:\n\n``` ruby\nuser = User.create!(account: Account.first!)\n\nuser.account_id = 10_000_000_000\nuser.valid? \n# => RangeError: 10000000000 is out of range for ActiveRecord::Type::Integer with limit 4\n```\n\nWhat happened was that during a `presence` validation for association it called a method `ensure_in_range` several times, which checks whether a value in a DB type range or not.\n\nTo fix this issue I would suggest catching the exception and adding `:invalid` attribute error to a record.\n### Other Information\n\nHere is a stack trace when I run tests without these

This allows attempting to pull the InputFilter via the InputFilterManager. If we cannot, we can use the composed InputFilterFactory in the Form Factory, and inject it with the FilterManager and ValidatorManager -- allowing us access to custom filters and validators.\n\nThis approach requires no addition of large components, and works with the features that already exist.\n\nTodo:\n- [x] Use the Hydrator plugin manager for hydrators\n- [x] unit tests\n",

That being said, while this directly addresses the issue, I'm not sure it's the most graceful way of doing it for a couple of reasons.\n\nFor users with existing configuration, this will force them to migrate their:\n\n``` hcl\nmetadata {\n    startup-script = \"echo hi > /test.txt\"\n}\n```\n\nto: \n\n``` hcl\nmetadata_startup_script = \"echo hi > /test.txt\"\n```\n\nThis results in a plan that detects a change to the config and forces deletion and recreation of the template. If that template is in use by a `google_compute_instance_group_manager` resource, then the apply will fail as a template can't be deleted while in use. Then you'd need to taint the instance group which would delete and recreate all instances created by it.\n\nSecond, this change isn't strictly necessary. While it is good to have consistent configuration, functions, and validations where possible between the two resources, instance templates are more restrictive than instances. As an existing instance template can't be updated at all, any change of any metadata at all results in the above deletion and recreation scenario. The original reason as far as I can tell for splitting the main metadata apart from the startup script was that if the startup script changed, then the instance should be destroyed and recreated so that it can be re-run. This left the remaining metadata keys to be changed freely. As all metadata is treated the same here splitting the startup script out isn't really needed.\n\nPerhaps a state migration would solve this? Or perhaps it's not worth the hassle and is simply a WONTFIX. Thoughts? :)\n",

Also, we've resolved the diff errors around\r\nmetadata.startup-script, and people want to use that to create startup\r\nscripts that don't force a restart when they're changed, so let's stop\r\ndisallowing it.\r\n\r\nAlso, we had a bunch of calls to `schema.ResourceData.Set` that ignored\r\nthe errors, so I added error handling for those calls. It's mostly\r\nbundled with this code because I couldn't be sure whether it was the\r\nroot of bugs or not, so I took care of it while addressing the startup\r\nscript issue.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n* When _importing_ instance templates, we assume any startup scripts are for `metadata.startup-script`. This means we can't do an import test for `metadata_startup_script` because it will check for `metadata_startup_script` in the state, and it will get `metadata.startup-script` instead. We have to make this assumption because until we have state to work off, we can't detect that `metadata_startup_script` was used. Imports (to my knowledge?) don't have any state, so we can't figure out what the user specified. This does mean when a template is imported, then its conf file is created, if the conf file uses `metadata_startup_script`, the next `terraform plan` will show changes to use `metadata_startup_script` in the state, instead.\r\n* Changing from `metadata.startup-script` to `metadata_startup_script` requires a destroy/create. I don't know of a good way around this, or if this should even be the desired behaviour.\r\n* In the event that both `metadata.startup-script` _and_ `metadata_startup_script` are specified, `metadata_startup_script` wins.\r\n* `metadata_startup_script` is for instances that should be destroyed/recreated when the startup script changes. `metadata.startup-script` is for instances that want to modify it without a destroy/recreate. Instance templates destroy and recreate on metadata changes, anyways, so there's no real reason to use `metadata_startup_script` in an instance template, but cutting down on the inconsistencies between resources seems like a nice thing to do.\r\n\r\nThis undoes the work @phinze did in #3507, so pinging him.

So here's for one final resurrection of the issue, with a proper implementation, using the XML-namespaces as seemed to be preferred by @jeffmo.\n\nIn my opinion, this issue points to a very pleasant _but not required_ feature that vanilla JS has, that JSX currently lacks. To me, it also highlights a possible issue with respect to best practices for sharing components and frameworks, as this may have impact design decisions depending on the authors preference for JS or JSX. Having to locally require and assign every single component intended to be used is _tedious_ and unnecessarily verbose. Simply being able to refer to a collection of components, as we easily can in JS, should be available to JSX as well.\n\n``` JS\n// In plain JS\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\nMyDOM.ComponentA(null);\nMyDOM.ComponentB(null);\n\n// In existing JSX\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\nvar MyDOM_ComponentA = MyDOM.ComponentA;\nvar MyDOM_ComponentB = MyDOM.ComponentB;\n<MyDOM_ComponentA />\n<MyDOM_ComponentB />\n\n// In enhanced JSX\nvar MyDOM = require('MyDOM');\n<MyDOM:ComponentA />\n<MyDOM:ComponentB />\n```\n\nThis brings JS and JSX to parity on this issue in my opinion, without inventing custom features or weird syntaxes, and it seems to me that this should not block any important future design decisions (that would be compatible with JSX), and it's entirely optional for the user.\n\nTechnically, the JSX implementation quotes invalid JS identifiers resulting from unusual characters in namespaces or tags (when possible), which explains the implementation of `quoteNamespacedTagName`.\n\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/facebook/esprima/pull/7 for `fb-esprima`, which is why the tests are failing.\n\nAll feedback and criticisms are appreciated.\n\nFixes #74.\n",

Notably:\n- The use of `npm explore` to run a command from the directory of a dependency didn't work correctly on Windows.\n- `npm init` and others that inferred the module name from the path failed with scoped modules on Windows.\n- Removing globally installed bins for scoped modules previously failed on Windows. (And was incorrect, but working by-accident elsewhere.)\n- Correct `npm cache ls` to output real filenames\u2013 previously it sometimes mistakenly double the package name in the path, resulting paths that don't exist.\n- `npm` now warns if you paste in a command line that uses non-ascii dashes (like emdashes or endashes), as this is almost certainly not intended.\n\nAnd one new feature:\n- If we got a cache-hit for module metadata but the version requested does not exist in the metadata, we then explicitly ask the registry for updated metadata. This removes one of the primary pain points of using a very high `--cache-min`.\n##### Changelogs\n- [v3.9.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.9.0)\n##### Reviewers\n\n**r: @zkat**\n**r: @TheAlphaNerd**\n**r: @Fishrock123**\n",

The existing asm code for S390 uses an ST/STG\ninstruction, with the memory operand associated with the general ('=g')\nconstraint to sp_addr.\n\nOn GCC 4.8.5, the GCC compiler got confused and treated sp_addr as\nan integer operand instead of memory operand, resulting in a store\nbeing emitted that writes to an invalid meory location.\n\nGiven the specific store instructions being inlined here, we should\nrestict the sp_addr operand to explicitly be a memory operand using '=m'\ninstead of '=g'.\n\nR=bmeurer@chromium.org,jkummerow@chormium.org,rmcilroy@chromium.org,yangguo@chromium.org\nBUG=\n\nReview-Url: https://codereview.chromium.org/2158523002\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#37809}\n\nFixes: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7659\n",

General tests\n  - Assert that `partial_fit` returns `self`. - Thanks @jnothman for [the suggestion.](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3896#issue-50330161)\n  - Clone test... `assert clone(est).partial_fit == est.partial_fit`\n- [x] 2. Check that an error is raised if the number of features changes.\n- [x] 3. Estimator reset test\n  - Check that doing `fit` after a set of `fit` / `partial_fit` restarts the estimator.\n  - Assert that `partial_fit` and then `fit` with a different number of features works without raising any Exceptions... - Thanks @amueller for [the suggestion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3907#issuecomment-68411916)\n- [x] 4. Check if `partial_fit` does not overwrite the previous model.\n  - Based on @jnothman [suggestion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3907#issuecomment-68478630)\n- [x] 5. Check that classifier handles correctly the classes argument in the `partial_fit`.\n  - a. Check if mismatch between `classes` argument and `np.unique(y_i)` raises `ValueError`.\n  - b. Check that error is raised if `classes` is not specified during first `partial_fit` call.\n  - c. Check error is not raised if `classes` is not specified during subsequent calls.\n- [x] Helper functions\n  - `_validate_y_against_classes` - Check label mismatch between `y` and `classes` arg\n  - `assert_same_model(X, est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_not_same_model(X, est1, est2)`\n    - Use `predict`, `transform`, `decision_function` and `predict_proba` to check equality of models.\n  - In `sklearn.utils.estimator_checks` `_partial_fit` and `_fit` to use the appropriate parameters.\n  - `assert_attributes_equal(est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_attributes_not_equal(est1, est2)`\n  - `assert_array_not_equal`\n\n**Refs**\nAlso see #406 - This PR fixes 1st under not so easy for pfit-able estimators, via 3a ( of this PR )\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/3907)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

Thanks a bunch for your patience!\n\nAs you can see, this is a semver-major bump for npm. That said, the actual impact of the release to the ecosystem is relatively small. Most certainly much smaller in impact than `npm@3` was. We're still sniffing out a couple of issues and might even put together an `npm@4.0.2` soon to iron that out before `npm@4` becomes `latest`.\n\n**THIS IS NOT A FINAL RELEASE** -- as mentioned in #8977, this is a preview of `npm@4` so y'all can start testing and taking a look at changes and make sure everything looks good before considering including it with official node releases.\n\nOne more note: With the release of `npm@4`, we've decided to move _both_ `npm@2` and `npm@3` to maintenance: that means we're unlikely to continue adding features to either of those, but will include critical patches, specially security patches, if something comes up. Regular bugfixes will not be done, as it's much better for our team to be able to focus on the latest release which we're standing behind. As far as Node Core is concerned, though, `npm@2` continues what we consider to be a sort of LTS release for y'all's sake. Maintenance doesn't mean it's no longer maintained, and users should continue to have a working experience with `npm@2` until `node@4` leaves LTS. `npm@3.10.9`, which I'll be downstreaming soon, might end up being our last `npm@3` release.\n\nSo without further ado, `npm@4`!\n##### Breaking Changes\n- `npm search` rewritten to stream results, and no longer supports sorting.\n- `npm scripts` no longer prepend the path of the node executable used to run npm before running scripts. A `--scripts-prepend-node-path` option has been added to configure this behavior. (/cc @addaleax)\n- `prepublish` has been deprecated, replaced by `prepare`. A `prepublishOnly` script has been temporarily added, which will _only_ run on `npm publish`. **NOTE**: This change only affects users publishing new versions of their packages and developers installing through git and local deps. Registry installs should be (mostly) unaffected by this change.\n- `npm outdated` exits with exit code `1` if it finds any outdated packages. (/cc @watilde)\n- `npm tag` has been removed after a deprecation cycle. Use `npm dist-tag`.\n- Partial shrinkwraps are no longer supported. `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is considered a complete installation manifest except for `devDependencies`. This will affect certain projects that relied heavily on this feature, most notably `hapi`.\n- `devDependencies` are now included in `npm-shrinkwrap.json` by default. This should make the transition to `npm@5` easier.\n##### Other Notable Changes\n- npm now sends two extra http headers to the registry ([npm/npm#14129](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/14129)):\n  - `Npm-In-CI` - whether npm was run within a Continuous Integration environment.\n  - `Npm-Scope` - the scope of the toplevel package this installation is for. For example, if you have a `@node/foo` package, all dependency requests for that package will include `@node` in the header, even if those dependencies themselves are not scoped or are for a different scope.\n##### Changelogs\n- [`v3.10.9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.9)\n- [`v4.0.0`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\n- [`v4.0.1`](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v4.0.1)\n\n**r**: @Fishrock123 \n**r**: @addaleax \n**r**: @jasnell \n",

There's a further clarification coming later this week, so we're not done with that bit yet -- so keep an eye out for [v2.14.13](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.14.13).\n\nThis PR supersedes #4003, but have a look-see over there for some discussion.
